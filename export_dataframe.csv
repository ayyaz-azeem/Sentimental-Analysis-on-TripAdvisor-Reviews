arcticantipodean,"PIAC lost my baggage on January 2, 2020 on PK786/894, LHR-ISB-KUL. The baggage never arrived in KUL. PIAC have taken no action to pay me the compensation I am owed and have remained uncommunicative in the ten months since this incident. Absolutely the worst airline I have ever dealt with in over 30 years of travelling around the world."
Haseeb,"I was very happy when I planned my vacation and thought to surprise my family.. but unfortunately when I went to the airport I found out flight is delayed for 4 hours. Flight took off around 6pm Pakistan time so it was not surprise anymore because I have to inform my family members as I was arriving very late at night. Secondly no social distance was maintained and 777 was totally full with passengers. Third thing Air condition was on its full speed and it was chilling in the plane, cannot understand that in summer AC doesn’t work or they don’t switched it ON and in winters it was on full speed. I requested Cabin crew couple of times and every time they told me the same answer that yes we will reduce now but did nothing. Finally I took out my jacket from my hand carry luggage and managed to cover myself for the rest of the flight duration. Cabin crew Age was almost the age of my parents and Male cabin crew specially was so unprofessional, looks like they are at that stage of their career when they don’t give a damn about anything like take it or leave it. At the end my I would clearly mention that my purpose is not to disregard my National carrier but until when these things will be stopped?? I would really request Mr. Arshad Malik to save our national carrier from this disaster service. Look into these kind of matters, why flight is delayed every single time we travel with PIA? Why Cabin crew are so unprofessional? Why we can’t be proud of our National airline? Being honest this is my last time I travelled with PIA and will stick to my decision until these kind of stupid issues will not be resolved."
Mina S,"This is the worst airline in the world. It took me $4,000 to get them to book an ECONOMY FLIGHT. In the middle of a pandemic. where other airlines are being accommodating PIA is seeing this as a business opportunity and up-selling everything."
Sean,One of the worst customer service I heard a crew member calling a passenger a bastard. I was shocked drinks limited seats has dust on them. No entertainment Very unsafe plane to travel on. Alot of passengers were complaining but staff just never take notice very ignorant. I even took an interview from them on my phone. For desperdaise channel. Habib Mirza
Hamza,"Dangerous flight, asked for blanket was told they ran out asked for water told it was run out what kind of service is this"
Ahad M,"This was the worst experience with an airline that I have ever had in my entire life. Going to be quick and say,"" DO NOT BOOK ON THIS AIRLINE!!!"" WHY? because inside their planes the TV does not work, food is terrible and workers are very rude. The worst thing that they did is tell me 5 days prior to out flight that it has been cancelled then later we got a phone call from our travel agent who said that the flight wasn't cancelled but our seats were. So they took our seats that we booked 6 months ago and gave it to someone else for double the price. THEY SCAMMED US!!! THE ACTUAL PIA SCAMMED US. So what should you guys do? go with any other airline even if it takes 50 hours longer still these idiots aren't worth it!!!"
Assassin S,Worst airline. i hope government ban this stupid airline. The title should be change from come fly with us to come die with us.
Bismah Saif,"Reasonable fare, good in flight service, landing and take off on time. Provides direct trips to most destinations is a best part. Pakistan Zindabad."
Dua,"If you wanna alive so dont travel in PIA flights, even in domestic flight also. Conditions of aeroplanes are so poor so better to avoid flight in PIA. Your life is important dont make your life in trouble and the evidence is in front of our eyes,3 horrible plane crashes and today's one happened from lhr to khi airline flight. So be safe and be happy and avoid journey in PIA."

Kalandar123,"The most Rubbish unprofessional airline anyone can ever travel, no comments to the cabin crew as they can't provide food if the management will not give or working TVs concidering it's a hard time for everyone Pia found the chance to over charge take advantage of ppl being stuck and then keeping them hungry for 8hours. Whoever the director is of this airline you will have to answer to Allah SWT do your very best in scamming ppl and keeping them hungry wait till Allah SWT shows you how it is."
Ateeb R,"Firstly, why is there no button to give 0 star rating, even a 1 star is too much credit to give for this joke Airline.Absolute disgrace, only had to use out of emergency (covid19) and not to do with choice.For the amount of money these thieves make you'd expect a half decent plane but instead you get a plane that probably hasn't been cleaned since 1996 (I say this as I was a young kid, who travelled PIA that year). My parents paid so I had no choice.Side note: No procedures in respect of Covid19. My family of 5 including 2 children 3 and 6 were split up and put next to random people, that's a great way of containing a disease isn't it?If you have half a brain cell you would NEVER use this airline until they sort their attitude and service out. Stop making them money, use any other airlines, I'd rather walk to be honest then use PIA.I for one will never ever set foot in a PIA plane again. Stay safe people."
MASSAGE THERAPI... M,"Being s patriot, I decided to fly through this operator but, faced disappointment. They cancelled my flight thrice with no legit reason.Then, I had to book other airline on urgent basis. I did not even asked them for refund due to frustration :/ God bless you :)"
Muhammad A,"Payed almost 900 dollars for a single ticket and it actually cost around 500-550 dollars. I was one of those specials flights. 1. It as 3 hours late because they couldnt find the cabin crew 2. I wont blame they cabin crew bad for service becaue of this epidemic but they were sloppy with other procedures. Planes was about to start accelerating on main runway but overhead compartments were still open, i had to get up and shut around 6-7 compartments. 3. No flight entertainment 4. Seats were in bad condition and food was bad. (BUT THERE WAS MORE LEG ROOM THAN QATAR) 5. But i have to compliment the Pilots, they were superb, i usually have earpain while descend and landing but this time not a thing. 6. They allow 46KG per bag so thats a plus. I will recommend PIA solely because of flying quality and 46kg other than that NOTHING"
Zaf R,"Old planes , old seats , service is crap but they do try to rob you at every point ..wouldn't bother flying with and it's the right time for it to go bankrupt . People need to wake up also they took massive advantage of the covid ..baaad PIA"
Fazal A,THE EXPRESS TRIBUNE > TECHNOLOGY Instagram's CEO is managing the billion-user network from his garage
lubz_313,"I am severely disgusted in PIA for the way in which they have handled the crisis of COVID-19. Having cancelled all of their flights upto April 5th, they have not sent out any confirmation e-mails regarding this. When I rang the airline contact centre in Islamabad, I spoke to Sameer Ali on 26.03.2020 at 4.42pm who told me my flight has been cancelled however they will not book me and my father onto the emergency flights leaving the same date (29.03) and same time (11.50am) as our original flights. When I queried why, he just told me he could not. I asked to speak to his manager which he refused and also would not provide me with his managers name. I further asked him for a confirmation e-mail my flights have been cancelled and he refused to do this. He then went on to cut the call on me. I am so disgusted this is the kind of service PIA provide to it's loyal customers. Do not ever book with this disgusting airline again, they will rob you of your money and then when it comes down to solving problems they will vanish on you."
Shazia A,"Though the airbus was a very old model and noise level was a little high, the leg room even in economy is quite big. Choice in food may be restricted, the staff was friendly."
Deh G,Absolutely disgusting. Being a pakistani with a bristish passport security ripped bags open threw everything no respect at all was told to boqrd without bags have no idea if bags are going to be there when i land absolutely digraceful service on the plane too. There was flies on the plane
Malik29,"I flew with this airline back when i was heading to pk. And not only that the plane was like 7-8 hrs late. They had really rude flight Crew attending. Specielly the Ladies, nothing Works on board like the small screens infront of u or the audio, so all u Can do is to bore ur self during the the loooooong hrs in the Air. And now they wont accept that the broke the refund law so they are trying to run away from that to. Cant recommend to anyone. Seek other ways to fly to Pakistan then this."
L Z,Baggage allowed is 30Kg with 1 piece. My dad is 72 years old. Would you mind telling that 70+ people and females will be able to carry 30kgs in on go. You guys need some serious coaching for policy formulation. Pathetic people pathetic service 😡😡😠 PIA
Suhail A,Planning to travel to Lahore for a short visit and booked a ticket well before. Received a phone call 30 hours before that seat is cancelled in Lahore flight and given a seat to Sialkot flight with no other options. Wasted a day in our holiday and reached a destination which is 170 km away without an offering of a transport. We have hired a private taxi to reach Lahore next day. Better to go with other alternatives flights with a stop over in the middle east.
Shehryar Sikandar,"The timings of the flight was great, at 9 pm and gave me more time to spend at London rather than other airlines which depart at night. Arrived 16 minutes earlier. There was no IFES but the inflight magazine made up for it by some extent. The inflight food was good, with the desert being my favorite part. The plane on the other hand wasn't clear from both, the outside and inside. The bathrooms had stickers to hide the damages on the plane's body. The stewards were polite and spoke softly. The seats plain terrible and their covers could easily be removed. Overall, I had an ok flight. If I were short on time, I would definitely use PIA due to non-stop flights and good punctuality on International flights. Yet if my main concern was to be switched towards luxury, I would choose the middle east trio airlines."
Shahid A,no onboard entertainment on way to Lahore or way back as no screens worked seemed they haven't paid their tv licence by the looks of things and the pilot didn't speak at all even to tell the staff to take their seats for landing as we could of been in Nigeria for all we know very poor overall and sad as wanted to support our carrier but not again I'm afraid
FM111,I would not recommend this airline Because it has the worst customer service plus the seats are broken and the tables are still dirty it was horrible experience and I will not be coming back on PIA The food was not properly cooked and the staff was very rude towards the members of the public please avoid this at all times this is not worth even going on to Not only that halfway through my journey from Birmingham Airport to Islamabad there were no toilet facilities such as toilet papers and water to wash your hands with staff members do not know how this was not working. As you can understand on a 8.5 hour flight this is unhygienic and below human right standards No apology was issued at any point during the trip or even after.
Cara A,"So, I must admit I was a little worried that I had booked my flights on PIA, but must say I was pleasantly surprised at the service. The service and food were great.It is clear to see the airline is working hard to improve it’s service and the staff seem to have undergone training, as they were so very helpfully, saying that “we are there guests and nothing is too much trouble”, this made for a pleasant journey. Although the TV screens don’t work yet, they are working towards improving the fleet. For the price paid - a direct flight was well worth it. I would fly with PIA again."
Riaz A,"Worst experience flying with PIA TV and charging device was not working almost 14 hours flight like sitting in jail. Washroom was horrible and flooding, can\’t eat food"
786mkhan,"Took this flight with my family and diabled mother, needed a direct flight. Flight delayed, while awaiting to board the flight the captain sat next to me and I asked if service had improved and if the plane was a newer one, 'Yes the service has improved hugely the planes are really good'. I did chuckle for a moment, but thought its been 15yrs since flying PIA, may have improved. 1st on the plane and the toilet bleach smell was the first thing that hit me, so many seats with such little legroom, Looked at my 15 yr old whos used to travelling on Emirates, his smile disappeared. We got to our seats we were sat close together but no inflight entertainment, most seats were broken, old and tatty, no legroom and really unclean plane all over. Food was ok 3/5 as the attendant mentioned the food was prepared in Manchester so was average, he told me the return flight food would be rubbish. We had got plenty of sani, sweets, chocs from Manchester on the off chance. Once food served flight crew non existant. Toilets had no hot water and when I queried this the crew member just shook his shoulders. PIA is really behind the times and really outdated, Im surprised so many still fly with them, I can only think as its direct. When I read other reviews from people from around the world about there experiences on flights complaining about basic things like, not enough drinks served, crew to busy to look after them, not getting a free upgrade etc, they all need to fly PIA and they will realise they are in heaven. Oh yeah our plane had mood lighting, stars in the sky, why have that updated when everything else including the plane are so dated. Please avoid where possible, fly emirates, etihad, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar they all have new planes."
mairashah2018,such a pathetic service ... pathetic food... rude staff... i think pia is the only airline who hires the women in their retirement age....who are already fedup of their lives ..didnt have screens ..ot even the bigger one on front.. u can't say where are u going where have u reached and what time is it....never going to choose pia ever again.
Arbab,"Thanks PIA, I have Traveled on Pk786 Dated 15th Dec 2019 London-Islamabad with Human remain. Due poor visibility at Islamabad flight diverted and Landed at Lahore airport. The dead body was belongs to Lahore and i was going to take it to Lahore via ambulance. After flight landed at Lahore Airport I contact PIA staff, explain the the situation and requested to let me Exit at Lahore instead of Islamabad. One of the crew member Mr Asad contacted a Senior Officer of PIA Shuaib Khan at Lahore airport who help me very much and make extra efforts for Off loading me with Human Remain, in a very short period of time he done the arrangement to fulfill immigration requirements as well as to deal with cargo to help me to off load at Lahore. He also guide me to the Cargo Terminal and explain the whole process which i was no aware off. He also helped to off another family of death case who belongs to Jehlum and requests for Off loading in Lahore. Here I also mention a cargo staff who also help me in all process of clearing human remain from cargo. I along with the relatives of Human remain are very thankful to these competent officers who are very caring and helping, I also Thankful to PIA Management who Improve the services. What PIA have done for me on that day, I will never be able to pay back. Thank you PIA. Thank you M Shuaib Khan, Mr Asad and cargo service."
Waqar Hussain Shah,"In my 10 years of stay in UAE, I have never used PIA services but this time just because of patriotism I booked this flight and traveling with my family. My flight PK203 supposed to fly at 01:50pm on 16th January 2020 and I got a call early in the morning that flight is delayed because of some technical issues and they don’t even know what what is that technical issue and the new time is 11:50pm now. I got furious at first but then controlled myself and didnt say anything to that agent as it’s not his fault. Later around 9 I took the taxi and reached at the airport at 9:45pm and upon reaching I came to know that flight is delayed for more 4 hours and now it will fly at 03:30am and the most ridiculous thing is they didnt even inform me this time. This is the most pathetic experience with any flight I’ve ever had and TO BE VERY HONEST I REGRET MY DECISION TO TAKE THIS FLIGHT AND IM SAD THAT I WONT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE AT ALL AND EVEN I WONT FLY VIA PIA EVER IN MY LIFE AGAIN. Im out!!!!!!"
Hedia A,Although the flight was delayed 5 hours I do not rate the company less than 8 as cabin crew I appreciate that the delay was due to weather condition and thick fog and delighted that it was not cancelled. Free meal voucher was issued for all passengers and great care at the airport for all passengers. Food on board is free and drinks round was twice served as well as extra water and tea and coffee Staff quiet caring as they were aware of delays and how passengers are tired. Leg room is good and toilets kept well clean throughout the flight.
Abdul Moeed,Pride of Pakistan. Had a lovely expereince with them. Flew from Islamabad to Doha Qatar. Had a lovely expereince. Food was good and service was good too. Will recommend it to others. Cannot wait to fly with them again.
hafiz hasnain s,Last 3 years I didn\’t use PIA. But that time due to non availability. I book with PIA. After boarding I thoughti will b late. But when I heard announcement I was really shocked it’s on time. During flight they inform we will b land before 30 mints. I was like what happen it that PIA. Then I check with some travel agents Now PIA is going Good. Because of new professional management. I pray for PIA. God bless the staff and management. I wish PIA become again number 1. InshaAllah Because it’s our Brand our pride.
Yasir Ali,Regular flying with PIA since 2018 and the service and food is great and tasty. I am proud to say the PIA is the safe airline in the world Just the entertainment need to upgrade and hope PIA will look into it in near future . Very pleasant and comfort flight. 💯
TravelSchah,"I am really sad to write this review. After watching all these promotional content and improvement projection from Pakistan International Airlines and Air Marshal Arshad Mahmood Malik I was really excited to fly with my very first PIA flight. My trip was from Abu Dhabi to Islamabad PK 296, Lahore to Karachi PK 313 and then Karachi to Abu Dhabi PK 4222. We were planning to go to attend my best friend\’s wedding. My friend\’s and I never flew before with PIA, for the obvious reasons (bad performance and terrible customer handling in the past). Unfortunately, this boat drowned leaving very bad impressions. I am a frequent traveler and a Travel Photo blogger, ref: @travelschah I do not like to write negative about services but I always love to share my experiences. During the flight from Abu Dhabi, when I entered in the aircraft, it had a worst smell in aircraft. My flight was booked but neither anyone mentioned to me that on domestic flight baggage is reduced nor in the email. My baggage was as per my international flight allowance. Which was reduced to 20kg without my knowledge. If I am flying from Abu Dhabi to Islamabad with 29kg of baggage, where I am supposed to leave the rest of 9 kg to fly with your unscheduled flight? But at the check in counter, Mr Haider misbehaved and literally shouted on me. I was impressed with such of wonderful PIA hospitality. Then I was handed over to Mr. Gondal who took me to ticketing section and without resolving issue left me there with Mr Ali Furqan (ticketing guy). Mr. Gondal asked Mr Furqan to check the ticket and confirm if I am not wrong. Mr. Furqan informed Mr. Gondal that fault is not from my side, it is their ticketing issue from Abu Dhabi. Mr. Gondal informed me he cannot help me out and I will have yo talk to Terminal Managar Mr. Chaudhry. They informed Mr. Chaudhry that its fault from ticketing. But Mr. Chaudhry said I can apologize the ticketing agency\’s fault and then clearly refused to help me. He was telling me stories how airline is firing people without any justification these days and this is why he cannot provide help to the passengers he need to keep his performance sheet clean. I didn\’t understand how you can prove your performance while leaving passengers devastated.At the end I had to pay extra for the baggage which was 5800 PKR. Not a big deal. I came back to the counter and collected my boarding. While leaving the check in counter, I heard Mr. Choudhry talking to a Young lady who\’s mother was on a wheel chair, who also has 7 kg of access baggage, that wait on a side he is gonna help her resolving an issue. I am sorry for ear dropping here but then I had to interrupt and ask Mr. Nice and gentle Choudhry that my access baggage was 4 kilo I had to pay 5800 extra while she has got 7, how you gonna resolve her problem not mine while you are eager to give her favor for nothing and my ticket was a poor performance of your smart ticketing office. While talking to Mr. Choudhry, girl ask me to stay out of THEIR matter. But eventually she also had to pay because I was not interested to leave until she receive the same treatment as I had. Leaving the issue behind, flight which was supposed to take off at 0800 on 30-Dec-2019 was rescheduled to 1200, later to 1400, 16:15 and then 1800 PST. It left everyone in frustration too. I had asked Mr. Choudhry that flight is more than 6 hours delayed now, what are the compensations for passengers, he angrily said, we are giving you lunch what else you want. While in departures food was without any thing to drink, no water or soft drinks. Let me remind you PIA is one of the member signee of The Montreal Convention which reserve the rights of passengers. As reference: \“In case of flight delay of more than 2 to 4 hours (in proportion to flight distance), the airline shall serve refreshments / meals to passengers (according to time of day) and offer communication facilities & hotel accommodation for the night when necessary (e.g. transit passengers / outstation passengers who do not have own accommodation). [ Article D 12.2.5 & D14 of ANO-001-ATCP-2.0]” I was an outstation passenger and I was not accommodated in anything. Which was strange for me. No hotel, no refreshments. Later came the food, without water. I ask the guy over the reception if he has got some water, he said we are out of water, go drink from the tap, he pointed me towards a water plant. We second part of it, “ When the delay is more than 5 hours and the passenger decides to discontinue his journey with the airline, the airline shall offer full refund of the unutilized ticket. [Article D 13.4 & D14 of ANO-001-ATCP-2.0]” While I was told there is a next flight for you so we can not refund”. I had my mother’s appointment with a doctor at South City Hospital Karachi. Thanks to PIA my mother had to miss the appointment because I couldn’t make it to Karachi.  I was so excited to travel with PIA, as I am a big supporter of National Institutes. But it turned into a worst nightmare. At the end I would like to close by addressing CEO PIA, Mr Arshad Mahmoud Malik that sir you are struggling with hardware, we can understand but what happened to basic customer handling skills? Not taught by PIA, I am talking about the real basics, taught by our parents. Where is the compassion? Where is the passion of this world class airline? Because this is the service standard which PIA possess at the moment. They have no respect to people And flight schedule what-so-ever. I am really sad to say that: “A big boo and shame on PIA“"
Azam,"Frequent flight delays - really long ones - baggage claim and cleanliness of the aircraft are some of the major issues - Our flight was via Lahore, the airport is in a pathetic state - Dirty, filthy, no maintenance, people smoking in the hall way - and much more ! Being in 2020 there is no flight entertainment - we still have a long way to go - the fares are not cheap by the way - there is no value for money - let’s hope more drastic steps are taken to improve the overall experience- Islamabad airport being new is nice 😊"
parveez s,Coming back I had temperature and I was looked after very well by the in cabin staff. Got lots of tea.food was excellent. Will recommend always.
Farooq Bhatti,"December 18-2019 was my flight from Dammam to Islamabad with my wife. We paid for for preffered seats # 3A- 3B but at KFIA Dammam we were allotted seat # 7D-7E. I, inquired about the change in seat number at check intime but duty official never bothered to respond and or to allot the seat for which I had paid as extra. While the boarding the plane, i informed the steward about this and they asked me to occupy seats in the middle of the plane which I did not accept. Flight was on time, Food quality requires to be upgraded. december 31st was my retrn flight, I, at check in informed the staff for my preffred seat 3A -3B and was alloted the same. Flight departure was 2.35 PM but even being a clear day it took off approximatelt 50 minutes late. and there was no announcement for the delay. It is a national flag carrier and utmost efforts shall be made for the timely flights and any required announcement for the delay etc."
Iqbal_manch,Travelled from Manchester to Islamabad and the flight was appalling . There was no inflight entertainment for the 8 hour journey. The plane was old and the seats were uncomfortable! Will not be travelling PIA again will find an alternative airline that puts customer service at the forefront .
Shaukat K,Our flight was at 2.40 pm on 27th Dec. Received a call@ 10.30 am advising it has been delayed to 5.30 pm. No apology or attempt. Employees at boarding very robotic and showing that they donot like what they are doing.
Mkan,"Very poor service, flight suppose to take off @10:40, while posting this I am still sitting in the plane and it 12:05pm. Zero information service from staff i.e ground, in plane announcement. Extremely poor service. No cause of delay announced. Trying it after 20 years with a hope things might be better, unfortunately it has gone bad to worse. If this is the way it is managed,PIA will not last longer. It will become a burden on government of Pakistan."
pacjet67,"Very Bad service as flight to Thailand, Bangkok was canceled/terminated in February 2019 but sales of ticket were still online in June 2019.... We arrived airport to take our flight back to Malaysia after our 2weeks if holiday and only found out from the airport customer Service counter that there were no such flight from this Airline coming into BKK. Made a call to the airline office and was reconfirmed that the fight was already canceled and airline will refund my booking. The thing was there were no confirmation message nor cancellation notice from the airline till my departure date until I made the call to the office. We were told to buy alternative ticket in order to proceed on with our journey home and email of cancellation were then received from the airline office. NEVER FLY THIS AIRLINE"
A S,"Compared with Serene, I had great experience with PIA last week. I traveled from Karachi to Islamabad."
Rida M,"PIA Lahore to Toronto is the only direct flight from Lahore which saves a considerable amount of time, energy and hassle especially for those with kids or elderly travellers. The service was amazing, flight was smooth. Another plus is they allow 28kg per bag in contrast to the 23kg allowed by other airlines. So thats 10kg extra allowance per person, and 30 if you are a family of 3! If you book in advance the fare is also good (I booked 50 days in advance and got a return ticket for 980 dollar per person). The only downside is no flight entertainment system but you can be prepared accordingly! Download things on your phone or ipad. Or just catch up on some sleep like me :p"
Anwar S,"Ever since the airline has introduced an Economy + service one doesn't miss the business class offered by other airlines. The fare is half that of Business class and the facilities almost the same. The food is great, the crew is courteous and to top it all one is entitled to the Marahaba Lounge in Dubai."
Syedalifestyle,They need more improvement. Fares are so high and service is third class. Air hostesses is like mother.
Raja,"Excellent customer service, proud to say PIA is improved a lot from past few years. The way it is going with new management team I am sure it will soon become one of the best and trustworthy airline"
Tade Ojo,"This flight was atrocious. The plane was old which was evident by the lack of infotainment and poor condition of the seats. It was a last minute choice due to a very poor visa service or I would’ve travelled on Emirates. Airport Expérience - not respective of black visitors I was subjected to 3 intrusive security checks on my luggage then passed on to the military guard who decided to go a step further and scan me then prod my body for drugs. If you aren’t patient and calm then I don’t recommend visiting Pakistan. It’s ingrained in the Pakistan Airport officials nature; black means bad. Treat them in such a way that they’ll either return on the next flight or will never return to Pakistan. This is a shame because the people I met were so appreciative of my visit, taking pictures at every opportunity, lighting up when greeting or thanking them in Urdu. My return was no different ; uncomfortable checks and disrespectful security guards. Note of warning : be mindful of the touts offering access to the Business Lounge for USD 20. The lounge is crap, the food..., well I didn’t dare touch it. Unfortunately I contracted a stomach bug on my last day which totally hit me for six; we’re talking nearly fainting on the flight out and 3 days on the bog with no food just water. Urgh!!!"
Sam,"Absolutely appalling! Checked my bag in at Manchester,collected bag at Islamabad, bag looked fine except for a 1inch split in zip but padlock still locked. Opened suitcase and found all my toiletries including mosquito spray,expensive makeup, basic creams, makeup bag and bottled water had been stolen! PIA you seriously need to film your baggage handlers. Thieves. Don't fly with these jokers if you have a choice, no in flight entertainment,dirty seats and cabin crew on both flights had a bad attitude."
Flying Out F,Pia changed lot in 2019.as its my national. Flag carrier so always to travel with my flag. They amprove lot this year.
Zaffybae,"Went to Pakistan on the 29th October 2019 came back 25th November 2019 Both times on PIA Cannot believe you pay so much money for a terrible flight No entertainment air hostesses and hosts ignorant and not helpful at all I asked for one of them to help as I am caustraphobic and need someone to stand at the toilet and hold the door ajar for me I'm also a diabetic so needed help quite often On the flight back was told by the air hostess NOT MY PROBLEM was absolutely disgusted. The food was so terrible I took M nd S sandwiches with me and also on the way back PIA need to improve their flights change the older employees for young happy ones and also train them in how to deal with customers, most of them had such scowls on their face I was afraid to approach them Not happy at all and I have been with other airlines where the employees have been courteous and polite Thank goodness for British Airways. I had to fly with PIA because my grandmother was ill so needed an emergency direct flight Never again Godwilling stay away PIA are a rip off old seating, blankets smelt old and was told they only had 5 pillows on the flight back No wonder they are losing customers."
Umar A,Do not fly. Old and dirty aircrafts with very poor service. No sign if improvement. No online checkin and you have to pay for seat selection. Food is poor.
hi b,"I travel quite alot and this airline is definitely by far the worst! No entertainment available on an eight hour flight. Staff are rude and unhelpful, they do not care about their customers. No blankets are provided either and the food is not up to standards You do not get what you are paying for at all. If you do not mind stopping over then definitely do not use PIA"
Shafique umair,I want use this website for buy ticket.i dnt knw what benefit this website give to me.i will try to use it more and more.
azz,is there any responsible person from PIA can answer us that why TV screens not working? why there is no audio system? on top of that what someone can do in 8 hours without entertainment ? any body? helo? knock knock?
Syed M,"Plans are too old and no entertainment system on long haul flights from last 20 years making journey very very difficult. Last time I travelled on PIA was 05th of Oct 2019 on flight 701 (Islamabad to Manchester) and found insect in food and when I informed flight attendant, I was told rudely not to eat it! rather than apology or any other explanation."
Dark night P,everyone should know that PIA has improved tis airline and is still working on it there are some ups and downs but it is far more better than the past PIA every one should support PIA as now it has improved i have traveled number of on PIA and i can tell you it has improved
faheemshah,"PIA - Great people to fly with (If survive) Step into Pakistani environment right from entering the airlines, smiling & welcoming flight person faces (ignoring screaming kids in background) welcoming passengers to (mildly lit) spacious cabin with loads of space for overhead luggage 🧳. The only airline allowing you to carry 40 kg per person & friendly staff let you carry more if you are lucky. (Un)comfortable, Mucky seats with broken - prehistoric & non functioning tv screens & roughest seat belts - will keep you tied to the seat for your entire journey (unless you bursting with pee). Served with miniature meals & unlimited, refills of mineral water keeps you well hydrated for your entire journey. Surviving the whole journey arriving at destination you need to carry a pillow & blanket as you will need to wait for your luggage for indefinite period of time. If your lucky enough to recieve your complete luggage 🧳 you need atleast a few hours to few days to celebrate & get congratulated & most probably rewarded to survive it all. Amongst the unlucky passenger half of our luggage arrived of all non useful boxes , and after waiting for good few hours we were told to leave our contact numbers for the staff to inform us when our rest of luggage arrives without giving us any estimated time, the staff advised us to call daily to inquire about our lost luggage. Wrapping our kids in plastic shopping bags without any nappies & toddlers clothes, scratching our back in the sweaty clothes we travelled we dragged our remaining luggage after been disappointed from the world most notorious unfriendly & non cooperative staff of PIA we went to the Parking to our transport to relax in the car seat straightening our back started our journey through motorway. Halfway through recieved the call from my brother in law who was informed by my sister, who was informed by mum that she recieved the call from PIA that they found the lost luggage 🧳 & to come & collect it. Turned our way back to airport going through security explaining the situation for unnecessary travel back to airport paying the airport parking charges again went to PIA desk , with grumpy looking people at reception asked us to pop in the back & identify our suitcases which we did & rushed it away to the car to avoid any further risk of damage or loss. P.S. this was international flight. We travelled in domestic flight ATR from Islamabad to Lahore - worst torture in my life - with ringing ears & loosing balance after flight. ATR should be banned these are not fit for travel unless you want to transfer your prisoners from jail or punishing someone. The torture of travelling through ATR domestic flight will make anyone - ‘Believe in God’."
Kazi Muktadir,Nice airline but aircrafts were old. Crew and air hostess were good. Meal selection must be changed. Have been eating the same menus for the last thirty years. Hear they are improving and upgrading their service and aircrafts.
Mohd Ali Khalid,"Flew with PIA from SHJ to MUX on Friday 1st Nov 2019. Upon arriving in Multan, waited for over 1h 30min for my baggage whilst carrying a toddler only to be told that the baggage has not yet arrived and it has been left in Sharjah. The bags contained very important luggage, such as clothes, food, milk, and all basic necessities of a baby and his mother. I was told that my baggage would arrive on Sunday, which was a lie. It arrived on Wednesday 6th of November. I am heading back to Sharjah on Friday 8th of November. My baggage arrived 5 days after me and my trip duration is only 7 days. Extremely disappointed in this service by our national airline. I am deeply ashamed, as a Pakistani citizen, to call PIA the national airline of my country. I am never to trust this airline again, or fly with them in the future including my trip back to Sharjah. I have flown in over 10 other airlines, and I have never been so deeply disappointed at any of their services. If an airline can’t accommodate the mentioned baggage limit in its aircraft, then why allow it? This did not only happen on our route, but also other routes of PIA. Over 50 passengers, and over 200 bags were missing"
confused traveller,"PIA is offering business class seats at the rates of economy class. In a bid to reclaim the top spot, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is offering a mega deal to its flyers. You can enjoy all the comforts of business class, including a meal while paying for economy class fares; After reading above description of executive economy from PIA, I upgraded my ticket to ex,economy for my return flight from islamabad to dubai at the cost of 27000 pkr on top of what i had already paid for economy ticket. Lounge at isb airport was acceptable, Very disappointed once boarded the plane, No audio or visual entertainment , Seat were same as economy with bit of extra legroom only,NO BUSINESS CLASS SEATS,as advertised, just a flimsy little curtains dividing front 12 seats from rest of cabin. Meals were bit better then economy, Staff was good . certainly not worth paying for. unless you can think of it as a donation to the country. I hope PIA will one day get its act together again."
K1ANY786,"This airline on 18 Oct 2019 decided to change the flight time from 23:10 hours to 21:30. When challenged they said they could do it and when reminded about the Warsaw Convention about international air travel a Dr. Yaseen, who is allegedly the station head for Pia at Lahore airport, stated it did not apply to PIA ???? In any event he refused to even supply accommodation or alternative transport. I relinquished my loyalty card to him and said I will not be needing it as I will never travel with this pathetic excuse of a company masquerading as an airline ever again. I was wasn’t the only one in this predicament.  The also have the nerve to have “Great People to Fly With” as their slogan. They are anything but I WOULD RECOMMEND WALKING RATHER THAN USE THIS SO CALLED PATHETIC AIRLINE I got a flight the following day with them and there are serious health and safety issues. The aircraft was filthy and in my opinion a breeding ground for various exotic diseases. Please see attached photos of toilet the broken seat is fixed with porus duct tape !!!!"
Salman A,"Well the flight was late at night but the warm well come by the air staff was immensely a relief. It was a very smooth transition from check in to check out. Seats were good, no knee bums to next seat. Air services like meal, water & soft drinks were highly appreciated."
Saba A,"PIA is known to be a terrible airline, but for me, it is no fault of the crew. The plane was delayed on the ground in Islamabad due to a technical fault, and while the plane was being fixed, they served lunch to passengers. What was terrible to see was the passengers throwing trash in the aisles and on the floor with no regards for other fellow passengers. Most of the passengers were traveling with families, and despite the airline offering free seat selection, most of them had not availed this option. While on board, they would then sit anywhere they wanted and not move, insisting on sitting with their families. Many parents would not stop their children from kicking on other seats etc, and would turn on tablets/phones on full volume without headphones for their kids to be entertained. Some even changed diapers on the seat and would place the dirty diapers in seat pockets stinking up the entire cabin as opposed to using the toilets. The way the bathrooms were being used was terrible as well. The crew tried to be as accommodating as possible given the limitations."
jafar u,"Out of touch with customers, rude and uncivilised creatures that represent the company as cabin crew, lies after lies on why flight delayed. Tried to bride with food to keep passangers happy and not asking too many questions. The cabin crew should no remorse or apology. Would never fly with this vermin company again the parisites are beyond believe."
Rukhsar B,"I travelled with PIA on Saturday 14th September 2019 to Islamabad, Pakistan via Birmingham, UK. I can safely say that I will never be travelling with this poor airline EVER again. When I boarded the plane, my seat was wet (I could smell vomit on the seat, absolutely disgusting), there were crumbs all over the floor and overall, the plane was in a poor state and it was clear that it wasn't cleaned from the previous journey. The staff, who are so rude, and think they are above everyone else, provide such a poor customer service. My mother, who travelled with me, has sciatica and needed to keep her leg warm, so I asked one of the staff for a blanket, which they refused, and said that blankets are only reserved for children. I was absolutely fuming to say the least. The food is of poor quality, the staff clearly do NOT care about the individuals flying, and overall such a poor experience that I am literally boycotting PIA. They should shut down and review the service they provide, considering that they are ""representing"" Pakistan is just horrific. Cannot believe they are 'expanding' their aircraft, LOL, such a joke, they need to put customer care first!!!!! I would give them an overall rating of ZERO- if I was able to!!!!"
Muhammad I,Keep on booking tickets for all flights scheduled in a day and later on habitually cancel flights and force to travel thru un-convenient scheduled flights with no option to refund. However offer ticket in limited flight at very high fare at cash counters.
Sohaib Tariq,I travelled with PIA in September 2019 on a domestic short haul. I would say service has improved as well as punctuality.
engr. Shams,"it is in real to ""great people to fly with"" PIA in real is growing and flourishing i loved the crew members their friendly behavior was beyond my expectations."
Jean R,"Our return flight Gilgit - Islamabad was canceled while we were waiting in the departure lounge after check-in. Our luggage had to be picked-up from the belt and that was it! No proposal for rebooking next day, no proposal for a refund.... We had to contact our travel agency in Islamabad for them to put pressure so we could bet a seat on next day light. This fortunately could be achieved in the evening. Otherwise the flying experience with PIA is OK."
SAM,PIA is good Airline ...and crew members are very friendly It was a good experience to fly with PIA........
Muhammad J,"I have a flight on august they sell our tickets to someone else. They are just doing their business nothing else. Bad experience and i will never go with this flight again. Never go with this flight just losing of our money. Bad behaviour of the staff inside the airport, inexperience person. Just hate this airlines for my lifetimes."
Farooq Bhatti,"PIA has introduced a special upgraded economy class named as EXECUTIVE ECONOMY, to enjoy the flight with the facility of BUSINESS CLASS. I wonder how dothey call it ""Facility of Business Class"". in A320 they have allocated 8 seats as EXECUTIVE ECONOMY. there is nothing like EXECUTIVE and/or facility of Business class, the seats are similar to that of the standard economy class and the unalloted central seat ( of a 3 seat row) has absolutely no utility. One can not relax properly in this arrangement and if you are not travelling with family this is even more difficult to relax. Weight allowance is 40KG, which is again a funny offer as if you are travelling in standard economy you can pay 40 SAR/KG for your extra baggage, which will cost you less for your 10 KG extra baggage. However the ontime flight shall be appreciated as outbound and inbound flights from Dammam to Islamabad and back to Dammam were exactly on time. Food for Executive Economy( white rice, chicken, and also special chicken gravy, yougurt, and sweet with atin of cold drink) was a bit better that than on served in econmy class(Rice with chiken, and ice cold vermicllies only)"
Experience540780,I am strongly recommend to travel with PIA. There online services are outclass. You can reschedule two time free of charge.
rahatali266,Really I like to travel with pia is best airline I traveling from Dubai to Lahore Pakistan every thing is very good hope next time I well Choose PIA
shahid1953,"Pakistan International Airlines are offering their Business Class cabin as Executive Economy. The fare being charged is far less than Business Class. As such, it is the right time to avail this great offer."
OKBK,amazing improvement in last 1 year. clean cabins good food excellent staff. i recommend to travel with PIA to all my friends
shahid1953,"PK-757 flies non-stop from Lahore, Pakistan to London Heathrow. The airline offers Executive Economy in place of Business Class. The cabin remains unchanged and you get Business Class comfort by spending Executive Economy fare which is much less. The seats may need new upholstery and there are minor problems. But overall, the bargain is very good."
Hamid M,"The worst possible flight to go on in you want to travel from/to pakistan, I’d definitely recommend any other airlines. The flight is mostly delayed, the crew have terrible manners, the planes are outdated, you’d be one of the lucky ones if your entertainment system works and in the majority of cases the whole entertainment system is down, the food tastes terrible. Travelling with another airline in the same economy seat genuinely feels like an upgrade to first class as compared to travelling with PIA."
KSKJADOON,"A very punctual flight from Heathrow. The 777 aircraft had a very clean cabin, two meals served and of a good standard. I travelled with elderly parents and their wheelchair and buggy service was top class also. The only negative was the lack of IFE. Other than this, not a single negative to report. I previously travelled 2 years ago and found a big improvement on this trip."
AbuHammad,"This is a sad situation. Our flight got canceled and we were called and told so but here is the sad part. We were given an alternative which we agreed to but in order to process the new ticket, we had to go to the ticketing office. I mean who does that anymore. Why can't they just send the new ticket by email. The onboard experience was fine. Food was ok and service was reasonable."
Kciff,"This is a tricky flight, sometimes you have good weather and sometimes it clouds over. One flight left on time from Islamabad, but the return flights, many, were canceled. Then there is no option but the road. It was slightly distressing to see the previous day's flight off the runway in Gilgit due to pilot error. But even minus one airplane, they were still flying."
OnwardTraveller,PIA retimed this by an hour a couple of days ahead of the flight. Fortunately this caused me no problem. It ran to time on the new schedule. Old plane but reasonably comfortable. Crew good. Small snack on the flight that I didn’t take (a sandwich and a bit if cake).
Abbas,Just avoid this airline. They have no courtesy to keep the travellers informed if there is any change in schedule.
aliakhtar1,"Horrible avoid , highly overpriced tickets , no welfare, Disgusting food and services ... avoid this ripp of carrier ... rude and ugly staff..... Tried to come back early 200 pounds extra per person to move the ticket back a month!!!! Dirty horrible airline , how are they allowed to fly anywhere ... allow other airlines to fly direct to Lahore. Avoid like the plague....... failed airline ... look at the state of the planes, Boeing , airbus don’t sell your planes to them... they will tarnish your brand !!!! Absolutely disgusting.... go on a cargo plane you will get what you want !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Amir N,"As soon as plane took off, an announcement was made thanking all passengers to choose PIA for this long-haul flight however the journey made us realize it was a big mistake as no value for money in return. When my wife asked for a blanket we were told that supply is limited and seniors and children are a priority. I fail to understand, if revenue is collected from all passengers then facilities should also be provided equally to all. A further announcement was made that in-flight entertainment is not working, imagine having to fly 14 hours without anything to do other than sleeping. Food was average, washrooms were not the cleanest. One positive which I consider a real improvement that the flight left ontime both from Karachi and also upon return from Toronto. However, I shall definately consider other options when flying long-haul in future."
TahiraSajid,We have been on this flight before. The courtesy of the staff. The friendliness and service has markedly improved. There were minor issues like the one of the seats of the plane was reclining and wouldn’t come back.
Edgeworth A,"Rude crew, No water in any toilet, No pillows,  No Blanket, No in-flight entertainment, Disgusting smell Substandard food"
Miss bibi,"Very very bad services! Very rude people. Do not recommend at all! Lost luggage, no support or tracked my items. Very low payment offered as everything has been declared lost; still fighting my case, not really getting anywhere with them. No customer rights support. Very disappointed."
Talat,"I was ill and asked for a blanket soon after the take off and was refused by staff as they do not have more blankets, hardly 15 to 20 blankets were available for whole flight, no entertainment in flight which is for almost more than 7 hours long. Food was average. Probably will be thinking using other carriers in future."
taquir,on 10th july I flew with PIA. They have rebranded Business as Executive Economy thus being able to reduce fares. The service on board was very good with flight attendants serving the passengers all through the flight. the seats were comfortable and the plane was all clean. Food was exceptional. The only missing item was flight entertainment. the flight left on time reached on time as well. this would be great experience to try by anybody and enjoy the reduced fares with more facilities especially the 45 kilo luggage allowance.
FDKamal,"I know this much that it was a Boeing 737. All 250 seats were completely full, prompt service with a savoury and a sweet served with juices (it is an hour long flight so serving tea/coffee in such a short time did not seem feasible). You can get lovely tea and coffee at the compact yet airy departure lounge (have to pay for that, of course). It is a very interesting airport, from the lounge to the plane you take the ferry bus which takes nearly 5 or more minutes to arrive at a plane which you cannot see or hear from the lounge! It is a strange high altitude desert and the airport does complete justice to its story-like appearance (I refer to James Hilton's Lost Horizon). I was pleasantly surprised to find neat and clean aisles, seats, folding tables, infact everything in full working condition. I had gone onto a PIA expecting the worst and thankfully got the best. And what a sight is it to see from above. I just wish the sound system or the pilot spoke a bit more clearly so that I could be sure that the mount I was looking at was really Nanga Parbat. Remember to say a quiet prayer for the lost souls buried atop that breath-taking beauty. Skillful pilots and a beautiful flight. Long live Pakistan and bravo PIA."
Lady Satti,"Sadly the only reason I flew with this airline because it’s direct to Pakistan. Unfortunately the aircrafts are old & tired, no movies, the food was abysmal & the crew were totally dead behind the eyes .. service was horrific and the safety standards were non existent Which is scary being ex crew. Over head stowages opening after take off & Landing, luckily nothing flying out. Passengers trying to get up once aircraft had landed and the crew didn’t say anything .. Not a airline I would recommend until things change"
Akber Choudhry,"The quality of the interior and the service may be below the standards of Gulf airlines, but the direct connections between cities in Pakistan and Europe and North America are second to literally none -- there are no other direct routes. The time saved is worth it. There are some recent problems with entertainment systems so please carry your own entertainment and reading to keep yourself occupied on those long routes."
Babbarali,"So i travel frequently with my family and we regularly use Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) the national carrier for Pakistan. This time around we were pleasantly surprised to see very good quality service on board the flight. The flight attendants were quite vigilant throughout the 7 1/2 hour flight and assisted us and my two kids (3 and 6) with smiles on their faces. To top it we had execellent quality food served at decent hours during the flight and were spoiled for choice. The menu has been increased to options of lamb, chicken, fish, kids and European. With British Airways having restarted their service to Pakistan recently and huge numbers of tourists coming into Pakistan, I think PIA realized and drastically upped their service a few notches. Since the flight is a direct flight between Pakistan and England, I would recommend it over and above Etihad, Emirates, Qatar and all other indirect flights. Considering British Airways was not able to take off on time and landed late in London (on the day of our PIA Flight) and PIA took of and landed as per schedule, I would recommend PIA to all incoming and outgoing passengers. Be warned though that their is no inflight entertainment, however this was not an issue for our family as technology has allowed us to keep our own ipads and smart phones equipped with latest downloaded movies on netflix on the 7 1/2 hour journey."
Ali Raza Khan,"Being a very frequent traveler to Dubai, I had switched to Emirates after a couple of initial disasters with PIA and Air blue. Due to the PKR devaluation, gave another try to PIA. Pros; - Flight was on time - Service has improved - Cheaper airfare Cons; - Old aircraft - Cramped for space - No pillows or sheets - Extremely uncomfortable seats - No in flight entertainment Overall : 6/10"
hafiz hasnain s,Flight was late 2 hours. Rude staff. They don’t know how to talk. They don’t know about service. This airline is worst airline. I will never use this airline
~FA*,PIA operates old aircraft but their service has substantially been improved in the last few months. Food quality is better now. The attitude of staff is improved.
Hamayon,From London to Kabul My baggage was lost for a few days. From Kabul to London My flight got cancelled. I am stuck in Kabul Avoid PIA
Ali Zaib,Best Flight dealing very good i prefer to fly with PIA it coming back in his original good position soon.
Curious50810926788,"I arrived at Jinnah Airport in Karachi after 3 international flights that went smoothly and all on time. I only needed a domestic flight to Islamabad, and when I arrived they said all the flights for the day were cancelled. They initially were giving me only a 4 pm flight the next day. I had to go to the main office and explain that I was alone and was meeting my family in Islamabad. Most people were unhelpful and unsympathetic, but one or two were helpful and helped me get a 7am flight the next day. PIA refused to pay for my accommodations overnight despite the fact that I was stuck overnight because of them. They also wouldn’t help me in finding another same day flight with another airline. I luckily had relatives in Karachi that helped me and I stayed with them. The next morning I came to the airport and the credit card on my booking was not correctly listed. Despite the fact that I was carrying the credit card that I paid for the flight on there was some error in the booking and they were telling me they wouldn’t let me on the flight. I had to argue, and most people again were unhelpful. They said the problem was my fault. After trying a few different people, I found one employee that helped me sort out the problem and I got on the flight. I had a tour through the north that day at 9 am and just barely made it on time. Never using sky tours or PIA again!"
shafiq1969,"I should have written this review years ago but my patience has worn thin. PIA used to be the pride of Pakistan and now it is the shame. The aircraft's air-conditioning system did not function. The crew told me the system had been malfunction for months but the ground staff were not willing to deal with it. The staff are always busy doing their own thing and at times extremely rude to passengers. I witnessed a female attendant leaning on a seat whilst she watched passengers struggle to find space the overhead cabins, nodding her head in disbelief at how they were unable to push their bags in to the space available. Her tone was rude and her whole attitude was poor. I won't blame the cabin crew entirely for their poor performance. The problem stems from the way the airline is managed. Some of the cabin crew staff have probably worked for the airline since the 80's and 90's. They are old school and with so much experience, probably complacent that no action will be taken against their poor performance. Years ago, i was about to board a flight from Islamabad to Manchester and with only an hour to take off a message appeared on the screen suggesting the flight was delayed. Hours went by and one bothered to come to the lounge to give any update. It was hot, passengers were getting impatient and some were become agitated. Five or six hours later, we discovered the plane bound for Manchester had been re-routed to Saudi to collect Haj pilgrims as their plane had broken down. What a shambles, i thought to myself. What can i say, we were left stranded at the airport and finally after a lot of abuse and arguments someone decided to feed people with the poor food that was available in the lounge. I have a lot to tell you but I feel it's pointless to complain. I have written to PIA many times and never received any response. Sometimes I feel, there is a design behind this madness. PIA has been set to fail, i feel. Why? I am not sure. Who benefits? Again not sure but I do know this, Pakistan had many routes, Karachi used to be a connecting hub for many airlines and now it isn't. Dare I say anymore. I caught two chaps smoking in the toilets. Went over to the flight attendant and gave their seat numbers. No one bothered to come and reprimand the idiots. The in-flight entertainment system is a shambles. 7.5 hours from Manchester to Islamabad and back, no air-conditioning and no entertainment. Staff never bothered to walk through the aisles and offer drinks, instead they let people walk up to the cabin crew and take whole bottles back to their seats, leaving little for others."
Umerah R,Poor service. Flight delayed for over 3 hours long. We were sat hungry and thirsty for ages.Every other airline sets off on time however pakistani airlines always sets off late. It shows that they are not a reliable service!
nayandutta,"Poorest Pakistani airline service. Awful people, poor food quality, mosquito and cockroaches, and what not."
14zeeshans,What a disgusting experience. I've never met such rude staff in my life as much as the ones I met in Manchester. One of the pia workers was called mr. gaffar and he was the most detestable in his manner towards not one but two customers on the same day. My son is travelling on the 7th of June for the first time on a Pia flight.. hes going to be sorely disappointed.
Dr. Zaheer Ahmad Qureshi,I booked PIA as I was late to Umrah and all other airlines were booked or very expensive. Booked Executive Economy which is termed as Business for PIA. I would not recommend PIA even if they are giving business tickets on economy price. Food was a buffet but okay. Welcome Drink served. The flight was delayed. Check-in was bad. The best thing was recliner seat so we can sleep.
Amina I,Another disappointment whilst traveling back from Pakistan yet again no inflight service so time was passing slow! Asked for water and didn’t get it!! Unfortunately I think PIA have lost a customer!
Amina I,I like to travel on the airline of the country I am going to visit. Unfortunately in flight service was not working and 7 hours was hard to pass. Food wasn’t to business class standards only consolation was the seats were comfortable... overall disappointed at the service of PIA and for the amount of money paid I don’t think I will waste my money next time!
SOQ2010,"Entertainment ,for 13 hours we watched the Gandhara art poster.Checkin was slow ,boarding was chaotic.Good points are it was punctual andno baggage loss."
Nadeem B J S,This airline was or is my least choise . But this time few things are good. Check in line was in bad shape. Business class counter was full of economy and protocol people . Flight was in time . But from Lahore it is bad time so breach evening . All day gone . From Dubai to Lahore time is 12pm . Again day is lost . They must improve their timing . Staff is just ok . Food is good . Value of money has no match .I mean over expensive like Rs 79000 lhe to dxb and back .
TahiraSajid,The airport staff was very courteous. The staff in the plane was very efficient and helpful. A clear difference from my past experience was noted. I don’t like chicken and I was given a vegetarian option promptly. Level of cleanliness was also better.
rizwan a,"I purchased a ticket from a travel agent, went to the airport but was told that I could not check in because I purchased the ticket at a cheaper price and PIA wanted £250 more before I would be allowed to board. I spoke to PIA on the phone and was told that someone was willing to pay the full amount that they wanted for my seat and if I didn't match the price I would not be allowed to board, in the end I purchased another ticket this time with Emirates and flew out a few days later I will never be using PIA again."
Maham786,"Overall This Was A Decent Flight I Went In July 2015 And I Didn't Really Like The Food, But I'm Sure Some People Would Like It, As Of Now (April 2019) McDonalds Food Is Being Severed As A Dish, From Toronto, Ontario To Karachi, Pakistan It Would Take At Least 17 Hours"
Tasneem R,I flew with my daughters from Manchester for a trip to Lahore. I experienced an excellent service with very polite and very attentive staff.The flight was excellent there and back. The food was delicious and drinks were served on demand.The only thing I would change is the uncomfortable seats so I rolled a shawl to cushion my lower back and that PIA needs new in flight entertainment..nothing worked but luckily we had our phones and tablets.
sametahir,There are no other options available. We have to fly with PIA weather you like it. The food quality is very bad. The air hostesses are not that smart they are rude and useless.
sgaundal,Flight was on time. There was comfortable seats in the aircraft 777. LCD on the seat was not working. Meal was average. Only option was rice chicken. The bathroom was just functional. There was bad smell from the bathroom. I reached timely on my both destinations. I think it is still a preferred flight than other local flights. staff was good and curtious.
Aizad A,"The boarding on the flight was on time. There was ample leg room in the seat in the aircraft 777. It is an older plane. The TVs at the seat do not work all over the plane. So take your own electric devices and earphones. Dinner, snack, and breakfast was OK. The bun was stale. A little too much salt in the omelette. They offered chicken but when we asked, we got mutton. I took a sleeping pill, had my earplugs, and eye covers and slept for around 6 hours. The bathroom was just functional, not much fancy. In the last 2-3 hours, there was bad smell from the bathroom. Anyway, we reached 1 hour early at Lahore. It is very convenient to be a direct flight and saves time and effort. So it is still a preferred flight."
Noshad A,"Worst Airline Service. Terribly bad. It was delayed for 13 hours from Dubai to Islamabad. Then another terrible thing happened to me two times. I went to Chitral 6 months back and a week ago, my luggage was not carried with me. Upon asking, the PIA personal stated they can either offload the passenger or their luggage. They are very stupid. I would never recommend PIA"
Sarah,I hate pia they are such idiots and our flight got delayed for 24 hours and they do nothing. It has been 4 months since we came back and we have emailed them and they still haven't replied back. I highly recommend never to use pia EVER. If you have used pia I feel your pain and if you haven't please do not use it. And last thing their flippin TV's do not work and if you have children what are they supposed to do. Ps: due to their bad costumer service and rude flight attendants we have made the decision to never use pia ever again.
Nomad726335,The customer service is none existence..after taking your money they do not want to know. Awful customer service experience unwilling to help. No consideration for elderly people... no respect. People only use them due to direct flights. Rubbish airline
A K,We are family of six and supposed to be flying on 06/04/19 at 20:45 from Oslo to Islamabad via PK772. But they've cancelled the flight and put us in a really bad situation and worst thing is we have been told to collect the all luggage also which was nightmare and sent us in to a hotel. About 250 people are effected badly and today is 07th April 19 and still no sign of flight yet. I would never choose PIA again at any price. If you are flying to Pakistan Please please don't choose pia otherwise they'll put you in a very bad situation. Book any other flights apart from pia because other airlines are responsible and have customer care manners. Prime minister Imran Khan should privatise or hand over pia to some neutral company.
Hamza T,"Based on my recent travels to Pakistan and back to Canada; this by far was the worst experience I have ever had. No pillows, no blanket, the food was so terrible and very very uncooperative staff. I would advise no one to experience what I have gone through. And to travel with another airline other than PIA"
OrientalCarpets,"I travelled from Doha, Qatar to Islamabad, Pakistan at the beginning of March 2019. The flight was fully booked as the airports in Pakistan recently opened after the shut down due to the escalated tensions with India. I was surprised to by upgraded to business class since many economy passengers where at the airport hoping to get a seat on chance. The travel time was around 2 hours and I really enjoyed the experience. The meet and greet by the crew was warm and friendly. The leg space and seat comfort was acceptable for the type of aircraft. The food menu had mainly local traditional cuisine which was tasty. I was interested to experience the new International Airport at Islamabad and found it upto par with international standards. I liked the decorations of traditional truck art that are displayed on the walls at the luggage claim. I would suggest adding extra toilets for passengers at the luggage claim as there is always a waiting line."
A Tauqir,"It is a big relief whenever a PIA flight is on time. There was a lot of turbulence due to bad weather but that's not anybody's fault. Their staff is usually courteous. The seats of the air bus are highly uncomfortable and the FOOD, THE FOOD delivered during flights needdddss a change now. It is the same old menu for ages now. I don't want it to be lavish but they can at least experiment with some variety."
Mallah B,"I have flown with Pia many times I have yet to experience good service from them. The crew have no interest whatsoever in giving that giving a personal touch to them it,s just a job. The plane was ok but the crew let them down. The food is just basic with a never changing menu.when I asked for a second coffee as I don,t drink tea they said they had run out of coffee. Overall they aren,t interested in their passengers no service with a smile."
H.M,"The only reason why people travel with PIA is because it is direct. However, I would rather have a connecting flight if it means that I don't get mouldy food, crying babies and the most awful customer service."
Shezine,"They use their monopoly of the direct flight to PK to secure bookings. Nobody in their right mind would use PIA if it wasn't the fact of direct flights. Disgusting attitude for flight attendants, obviously no training was given around customer service. I cannot believe how disrespectful their staff are. NO in-flight entertainment which is ridiculous for the most expensive flight carrier to PK. Their prices are way over the top (with service received) compared to some premium carriers (i.e Emirates, Etihad, Turkish). Flown Etihad last couple of times and I must say, WOW. The service and quality made up for the stopover. I would certainly like to help my fellow countryman but you guys need to start treating people a little nicer. Maybe, just act like human beings :). Come on PIA, I think a revamp of your staff is in order. Also, you need a Tech team to sort out your in-flight entertainment. If you can't manage that then please start having other carriers flying"
flyfisher66,"It is becoming a dream now to travel with PIA without facing an issue. Just two days back, I had a very good experience during check in and I explicitly mentioned it in my review. This time it was the other way. Two of us had three baggage, a duffel bag weighing 16 kg, a medium size suite case weighing 12 kg and a carton weighing 4 kgs. I was carrying a hand carry weighing around 5 kg and my friend was carrying nothing in hand. We were told that though our total weight for 2 tickets (32 kg) is well within our permissible limit of 40 kg, we can only book two items in the baggage. We told the person on the counter that the third item is a small carton weighing 4 kg only and that our total weight is well within our authorized limits. But the guy kept saying that he can only allow us two bags, no matter what the weight. And then, he came up with a startling solution that my friend who wasn't carrying anything sould carry the medium sized suite case (12 kg) as hand carry. We tried to tell him that this suite case is well over the permitted weight for hand carry (7 kg) and also, it is a bit oversized too and may not fit in any of the compartments but he refused to accept our logic and kept insisting that he has to follow rules. We finally gave up against his logic and my friend had to carry an oversized over weight case as hand carry. The cabin crew, rightly so, objected to the size and had to make extra efforts to fit it in one of the compartments. Withoug being clear on the rules themselves, PIA staff nowadays is getting unnecessarily strict on implementing the rules, that too their own way. We found absolutely no logic in allowing a 12 kg oversized hand carry and permitting two item in the booked baggaged weighing 16 kg and 4 kg respectively when the weight authorization was 40 kg; on the pretext that two of us are allowed to book two items only. This is poor professionalism. The leg space in this aircraft was very good and we faced no problem on that count. There was no arrangement for inflight entertainment. The flight time was 1 am, the lunch time, but we werent provided lunch rather were served with light snacks. In the same amount or less, other airlines in Pakisan do provide lunch or dinner during domestic flights. PIA needs to look into this aspect."
flyfisher66,"I had terrible experiences during checkin on my last four flights with PIA but this time, it was a pleasant surprise. I requested for a change of seat and the gentlem said that though none is available but if I wait for 15 minutes, he might have a seat. I sat in the lounge and in 15 minutes, the guy came himself with a new boarding pass having a seat of my choice. This was high professionalism and very good customer care. Few other passengers also mentioned an improvement in customer service which is heartening. During the flight, there was no in flight entertainment. As for the food / beverages served, the standard was quite mediocre and most of the items served were cheap and ordinary. I really feel that PIA charges enough during domestic flights to serve its customers with a decent meals / cup of tea."
rahatali266,Really very good service😃excellent staff flight conditions is very good I like to travel again with Pakistan airlines thanks PiA
Ahsan Jalil,"I lived with PIA terrible service since I started flying around 20 years ago. But put up with this terrible airline just because it was the only direct flight to Lahore from London. But now it has come to the lowest possible standard that I had to write this review. You could clearly see the corruption has eaten this once great airline from the core. The flight crew and check in staff, you can see corruption and nepotism written all over their faces Customer services is non-existence, those who have travelled in local buses with service crew can rest assured that those people are much more well mannered and behaved than these illiterate people. Aircraft seems never cleaned, and that dirtiness reflects on the staff faces as well. They charge you premium fare for being a direct flight and provide you with the filthiest service possible. There is no entertainment system in flight."
Shawn M,"friendly staff,, hope its improves better ,, pakistan airline is the best its way better than indian airlways"
Jandre,This is next to China air. Don't do it. Take Shaeen at a min. I remember when PIA started and helped build Emirates into what it is today. Unfortunately PIA got the short end of that stuck and isn't much different from China Air. It is a safety issue at a min.
Nadeem B J S,It's executive economy is good. Seats are ok batter the Oman eco.this time staff is good and food is also good . Big benefit is direct from Lahore to London 8.20min . Most of the time it is delayed . Do get fast track card from Pakistan. The don't give it in plan
Kamran W,"I flew with PIA after a decade and was expecting a rubbish experience as the only reason I decided to fly with them was the direct flight (British airways starting soon as well btw) I was actually pleasantly surprised, The staff were really friendly and helpful, the food was good (as good the plane food can be) The flight was on time and we arrived 10mins before the scheduled time All the tv screens were turned off which I guess is because most of them were faulty so to stop people asking them to fix theirs , they just turned them off I think but most people had their own phones and tablets to use but in the future they definitely need to sort it out which I think they will as they’re buying new planes I\’ve heard. Overall not a bad experience for me especially when I was expecting the worst service possible but I think they’re trying to make an effort, let’s see"
ADNAN,Its just good but not excellent service compare to other Airlines. Food given by Airline is just okay.
SarahKTravels,"We flew Economy Plus to Madinah and it was my first international PIA flight in over 2 decades. I was blown away by the kindness of the staff. Their helpful and friendly attitude, smooth take off/landing and overall value for money. Yes, the plane did feel a bit worn out but everything worked fine. Moreover, the economy plus seats were those of the business class section and were able to recline to almost a full 180°. (This was not the case for our Jeddah to Islamabad flight where the economy plus seats simply offered more leg space and comfortable seats, as is the nnorm. There was no inflight entertainment so if you're traveling with children or on a long haul flight, that's something to plan for in advance. I did not have the food but those I travelled with said it was piping hot and pretty decent, so I'll take that as a plus. Other options to fly to Madinah included layovers in the UAE so this direct flight was perfect for our needs. Look forward to flying with them again!"
Terry I,Staff n flight great However put my books in luggage only to find I was on an 8+ hours flight with no inflight movies. Can u imagine just sat that long with nothing to read except or see except inflight magazine or emergency information card or the outside of the sick bag
maheen i,Worst terrible ever flight staff was good pilat and time of flight was perfect no complaint about them but no facilties worse food ever children were bored it was horrible time smelly seats and no cleaning everythg else was disgusting. Nothg else to say.
Atif,Pia new online webtickting system is very rubish because i apply for ticket on pia website and system deduct amount from my account butt till now 3 days not ticket not refund and call centere said just wait we are checking. Very very poor system.
@pakistan123,"Living in Pakistan, I've been travelling with PIA a lot! It's really good! Sometimes, you may face some problems, but that's not very often! I recommend it!!"
Shafina A,No in flight entertainment informed that they have been out of service for over 3 years and they won't provide any earphones if your did by chance . Endured very bored kids making it a noisy flight. Food cheap and chearful and bland. Breakfast probably cost them £2. Paid over £600 for the flight. Seats and planes outdated. Only fly using them if you have too.
Hur H,"PIA cancelled my ticket without informing me and I was only told on the day of my departure. I was then asked to purchase another ticket to not to miss the plane and was informed that the airline will reimburse the money. I trusted the staff and the airline and purchased another ticket at the airport on 28th of December 2018. Today is 1st of February and PIA is holding my two payments for one flight to Islamabad. In total it cost me GBP 538.21 + 1,162.51 = GBP 1,700.72 for economy class ticket with PIA. The customer service is extremely bad and no action has been taken so far which means some of my business also got affected."
Muhammad AsifAli,Low fare flights for dubai. Flight delayed by 2 hours. Flight Information cell informed me about the delay of flight when i was standing in q at airport for boarding.
Sobaan,"From BHX to ISB, everything was fine. BHX airport has numerous shops and restaurants and there were no delays with boarding. The food they served was lacklustre; bland chicken and rice and burger/sandwich. Drinks option was fine. Worst thing was having NO IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT. The PIA website boasts of having IFE, but all we had a was a very old and small screen at the back of the seat that only displayed flight information. 6 years ago, we had the option to watch videos/movies, but that, for some reason, is gone. I do not know who would like to view the flight's speed or altitude; after a while, it gets incredibly repetitive and frustrating. In fact, the pilot even said ""We have IFE for your entertainment"" - I do not know how on earth flight information is entertaining. ISB to BHX wasn't as good. The new airport is indeed very big and modern, but there aren't that many shops there and only two food places that serve sandwiches and tea/coffee. Army members are littered across the airport, which is quite scary and unwelcoming. During security, they do nothing but stand there and watch you try to put your luggage onto the conveyer belt, then they tell you to push it into the x-ray machine yourself, while standing there smugly. No smiles, no manners, nothing. Then, they charge some sort of service tax and also charge us to print photocopies of our passport; luckily, I had some money with me. Boarding gates opened at 11:05, flight departure was at 11:50. Unfortunately, we were still waiting in the boarding area at 12:00 and then the announcement came saying delays until 13:00. Luckily, back-seat people could go early, and we entered the plane, which was sweltering! Eventually the plane went off after a delay of 1 hour. Again, lacklustre food, no IFE; sandwiches they served were hard; legroom was decent but not the best for taller people. Toilets were blocked often as well. If you fly by PIA, DO NOT expect luxury if you are going by economy. Expect delays, bad food, passive aggressive flight attendants, and no entertainment. THE ONLY good thing about PIA is that it goes DIRECT to Pakistan; otherwise, anybody foreign would never use it. Next time, go by Emirates, which has one layover, but much, much better services."
minsagirl,I flew to Pakistan with family young children obviously you would expect in flight entertainment nice food and airline facilities that work like the light the toilets the aircon the call button the only thing that works on PIA is the gas pedal and the brake pedal the rest of the things DO NOT WORK my daughter was so bored she luckily took her own entertainment to keep her occupied unlike some parents didnt I am surprised an airline like this is actually taking passengers back and forth without anything working they should be banned from flying never again would I ever fly with PIA never would I recommend the flight to anyone if anyone does want to fly it's under there own risk good luck the screen shows only 2km traveled even after 6 hours
Ember,Firstly the flight got delayed for 2 hours. There was no announcements about delay. When it finally started the food served was below average. Just a plain sandwich and brownie. People were sitting at the airport from 1pm without lunch and the service in the plane was poor and pathetic. Staff seem restless and angry. Without smile on their faces and speaking arrogantly with passengers.They were just doing their duty for the sake of duty. No hospitality or courtesy shown.
Masroor A,"I travelled from Toronto to Karachi with PIA PK 784, Jan 06,2019 with 2350CAD$ fare. Far high from other airlines. 1- They served Haram Dannon yogurt, 2- served used blankets, 3- Food quality was worst, bread was old. 4- No AC during flight. 5- Staff was tired and bored to serve. 6- in this direct flight juice was finished. 7-washrooms doesn't have accessories. Few washrooms were not working. 8- No entertainment. 14hrs flight and all TV were off and was not working. 9-Announement was worst or no announcement at all. 10- many lights were not working.Won't recommend this airline. Thanks Regards Masroor Ahmed Toronto, Canada"
MeggySS,"We arrived in Lahore for a 13 hour layover. Against our consent they removed our passports from us and questioned us intently about why we didn’t have a transit visa to enter the country. After an hour we were escorted to a transit lounge - a room full of metal chairs, a water cooler which was bone dry and disgusting toilets at the back. Security guards stood at both entrances to ensure we didn’t escape. We stayed in this room, with nowhere to sleep, no WiFi, and no access to our passports for 13 hours (t concerns me most). Periodically we were brought food by airline. Finally our time came to be escorted through the airport to our gate. We still did not have our passports in our hands, they were withheld from us by airline staff. We waited at the gate until the final minute, finally the airline escorted us to the plane and our seats and handed our passports over - not to us, but to the flight attendants. We had a short domestic flight to Islamabad and upon attempting to leave the plane with the rest of the passengers we were prevented from doing so. It took an hour of the pilot arguing with the ground staff before we were allowed to leave and then we were locked in a bus whilst they disputed our situation until finally driving us to the terminal and escorting us through the airport to the check in gate. This all sounds simple except we were marched back and forth through the airport, explaining the predicament repeatedly to staff who appeared to have never managed this situation before. Again, this flight was booked through PIA so none of this should be news to them. Three hours and counting, we are forced to pay an airport tax we weren’t previously told about, sent to get our luggage from downstairs, and we still do not have our passports. Immigration staff argued with us throughout that we should have a visa - we explained repeatedly we have not and will not leave the airport. Our final flight departed 2 hours late and (news to me!) stops in Beijing on the way. There is no running water on board -the toilets don’t flush, the taps don’t run and no one can wash their hands. We’re delayed in Beijing for 7 hours and the problem is still not fixed. We’re on the flight I believe for 16 hours in total. Cue the worst case of food poisoning I have ever experienced. For two days we only ate food the airline provided to us, so I’m certain it was contracted through PIAs poor hygiene. I won’t go into the grisly details, but I will highlight my point above that there is no running water on this plane. I apologise to my fellow passengers for adding to the misery. Thankfully, after 24 hours i was doing okay and able to move about. My boyfriend could not leave the hotel room for 3 days and only after we visited a doctor for an emergency appointment (and is prescribed 5 days of antibiotics, probiotics and rest) is he feeling better. Just in time for us to fly home! Our return flight isn’t much better, delays and then a 16 hour layover in Islamabad. It gets much worse, when after 2 hours of waiting for a staff member our passports were removed from us once more and we were escorted past immigration - against us repeatedly informing that we cannot enter the country, we do not have visas, all to the response of “no come with me I will sort it”. So we cross the Pakistan border illegally and again no one knows what is going on. We’re left waiting for 2 hours, alone without our passports, in the open lounge of arrivals 200 yards from the taxi rank. If we had wanted to illegally enter Pakistan (which we didn’t) they sure made it easy for us! They keep trying to say we will taken to a hotel, again it’s explained we do not have a visa to be here and it’s making us nervous. Eventually we are escorted back to departures with the aim of getting our boarding passes and some sleep. We l are promptly stopped by armed guards. We don’t have boarding passes or visas, therefore we cannot enter. We explain that staff brought us past security (which they deny!). The staff blame us, stating we entered the country illegally and we should have known better - I suppose we did, but not voluntarily and definitely not with any intent. We just wanted to be on the next flight home. Two hours later, after the changing of the guard and a tantrum on my part the Big Boss is called and he escorts us through security. We are told to wait, on two chairs, for 8 hours until we can check in. We still do not have our passports in our possession and we are not brought anything to eat or drink (not that we would have eaten what they brought us). Eight hours later and we are finally arguing with immigration again - we’re forced to pay another airport tax because we didn’t have a receipt from the last time - we are reluctantly given boarding passes and allowed through security, and escorted to our gate. Our passports are finally returned. The flight home, whilst delayed, has running water at least however no air conditioning. We declined to eat any food they offered and chose to fast instead. TLDR: The entire experience was a shambles, the airline clearly couldn’t manage transit passengers and no one knew what was going on. We felt like criminals and our passports were removed from us for 12-18 hours at a time. We got food poisoning from the food and there was no working toilets/running water on the flight and we had to access emergency medical attention because of it. I won’t be flying with PIA again, they haven’t offered an apology or even acknowledgement of what we experienced and I strongly warn others against flying with them."
Rifat B,Never travel by this air line mouldy food and terrible seats bad service. I told then I am pregnant and they said why did u travel maybe because I had to bury my mother in law. Disgusting.
Shehl,"The staff was very courteous, the flight was direct to Karachi and reached on time. Good food choices . the seats were comfy but some gadgets were not working. However there was plenty of empty seats in the business class"
Adventure292498,"The service has improved a lot,The crew was kind, courteous and ever ready to cater to your wish. The food was good.We got Breakfast,snack and lunch before arrival."
Arian E,"I read all the reviews before flying but still wanted to go with an open mind. I am so terribly disappointed with my flight. - the planes are in horrible shape. Seats ripped. Smelly, dirty. No inflight entertainment at all. - business class is so cramped. I felt like I was sitting on top of the person next to me. - my seat barely worked and when it did it was so loud. The poor woman in front of me had a seat that didn’t work at all. - usually the food is the only redeeming quality. But it was terrible. - I have no idea why there are 6 cabin stewards serving 35 business class passengers. They do nothing."
Aaliyah Sharif,The only reason we flew with PIA is due to the direct flight to ISB. The plane itself was old. The flight was delayed. No in flight entertainment. Food quality very poor. Rubbish not properly collected from previous flight. Overall extremely poor considering they charge in excess of £1000 for economy flights! Waste of money!
Aatmah M,"The only reason i take this flight is because of a direct flight from mamchester to lahore. Infotainment has not been working now for 8 years !!!.. Toilets are dirty, the tube light was lying on the floor ! Food was good and people were great!"
Nadia S,"Paid over £1000 for the ticket, boarded 5.15 pm, flight was supposed to leave at 6 pm however delayed till 7 pm. Once in flight, the food was served at around 8 pm. From the moment we boarded to the time we were served food (circa 3.5 hrs), not even a glass of water was offered to the passengers in spite of asking! Parents were seated in a different section to their young children, causing a massive uproar naturally. When parents asked for blankets for their kids, they were told to share because there wasn't enough to go around. On a 7hr+ flight there was also no entertainment facilities. All in all, mayhem and the worst flight I have ever experienced."
Matthew C,"What a farce for an ""international"" level carrier - it was a case of ""hurry up and wait""...Original flight scheduled for 1500 departure, Sat 22nd Dec 2018. On the morning of the flight at 1100 we get a call to advise the flight is rescheduled for 1200 (noon) departure!! Fortunately we were only 20min to the airport - but it was rather concerning that it was suddenly so early - and we prayed they would let us check in! We arrived and were able to checkin - advise - ""Don't worry, not to rush, it was still ok, the flight would leave a little later..."". When asked what the new time was it ranged from ""Its still saying 12"" to ""just go to the gate"". So we get checked and sorted and go to the gate expecting that they would be calling us to board anytime soon. At the gater - there is no one! No signs, no PIA staff, not even an electronic board to show the flight status. The only sign was 1 floor up, and it had said 12noon departure when we went past. Tried asking airport staff - who reported that the scheduled 1500 departure was still correct... and when I tired the PIA customer helpline, they said ""Speak to airport staff"".... So we went back upstairs and found the signs had been updated - flight delayed with a new scheduled time of 1430. So we go find some lunch and wait... Back at the gate by 1415...wait... 1450 they finally announce boarding. Get bused to the aircraft and everyone boards. Wait. Wait some more. We finally get pushed back at ~1530. So, all told, we were given the hurry up to be 3 hours early for the flight, when in fact it left 30min late!!! And - not even a mention or apology from a single PIA staff or a call back. The funny side was a call 30min after we had arrived to let us know the flight had arrived. Thanks - we figured that - given we were on it! I wondered whether taking the bus would be less trouble and get me there quicker...?"
Zafar M,On time. Reasonable service. Food was above average. Seats were not very much comfortable. Staff was cooperative
Umair K,As a world traveller I have travelled almost the whole world with very good and bad airlines. So I know what service and expectations I should be expecting from PIA! Some people moans just because they think one could get better service if pay less well certainly it does not happen in an aviation world!! I have flown PIA before but with this particular trip I choose PIA BUSINESS because of its direct flight connection to Islamabad. The checkin at the airport was fast and no trouble. The lounge was good enough and the priority boarding was ok! The plane was clean and seat was comfortable with full recline ( I slept 3 hours)... food was great but the service could be better. It was my first business class trip on PIA and I think it was great!! Well if you compare business class with emirates then GREAT would not be so appropriate but Emirates fare for business was 2 times more than PIA so it was not too bad after all. PIA definitely needs to improve their customer service and time management. I won’t hesitate to fly business again with PIA. PS: can’t wait to fly BA next year (the only reason I will prefer BA to PIA is my one world silver membership and benefits. rest BA is not that much better than PIA!)
Firrah S,"So sad that although this is a direct flight from London to Lahore and you pay through the nose for the convenience there is not a lot to say that is positive about this airline. First of the state of the planes is dire even in business class, they do not have the facility to charge up your laptop/phone - why is it called business class? The crew are really not interested - (except the odd one) in your needs and are not very helpful with anyone not even if you have physical problems/mobility issues. The only reason we fly with them is that it is a direct flight from London to Lahore and one of my parents has mobility problems and taking them on and off flights half way is inconvenient and problematic for them. Having this monopoly should not mean that PIA treats you as badly as they do. We only travel with PIA when we take our parents otherwise we prefer to put up with the inconvenience of lay overs and scarily for that 2 hour inconvenience we pay almost half the price of PIA and at peak times we save even more."
Tauseeq18,"Iv been travelling in PIA from a very long time now, and overall its very good.People being cliche always under rate our airline"
Nadia M,This is a review based on my own previous flights with PIA and my brother's recent trip to Pakistan via PIA he had the worst flight there and back. The lack of knowledge and understanding of English made it extremely hard to interact with any working person at the airport and customer service was very bad. Staff was very rude to my brother I have had the same experience in the past. He nearly missed his flight because they spent half an hour argue with him. I would never recommend this airline to anyone. They need serious training and customer service relations. And improve in flight entertainment as it's never working.
abids536,"I always fly with PIA when I visit Pakistan. Cabin crew are smart,always attentive & prompt. Best thing is that flight is Non Stop both ways & flight time is less than 8 hours both way compared to more than 12 hours atleast on other aAirlines & compared to all other Airlines that fly to Karachi from UK; PIA is best value for money."
Ash,"The cabin crew are very rude, they just rush past you when offering drinks, which makes it hard for you to even ask for something. The screens did not work at all, no options for movies or entertainment. I do NOT recommend this airline at all!"
Abu F,"Comfortable, great service, polite and courteous cabin crew. Its a long 7 hour 40 min flight, the crew look after the passengers. Only downside is that some of the passengers were rude, ill disciplined."
Alishba A,"The direct flight was 14 hours long and I was able to sleep peacefully as there weren't too many kids on board. Lunch/ Dinner was really good. The breakfast, not so much. Stale Bread!! I booked this flight because my Saudi Airline flight got cancelled and i was looking for the most reasonably priced ticket. This flight did give me value for my money."
farhannoman,I would only recommend PIA if you can’t be bothered to stop over and change the plane. The only advantage is you get a direct flight without any entertainment for 8 hours. You either sleep or look around. Food I would say it wasn’t bad. They have really improved their service. Leg room was good. There is no such things as “Economy Plus”. They do need to upgrade their planes. Pillow not provided unless you ask for it. The only asvantage is you just get a direct flight. Ohh yeah radio wasn’t working as well wven though headphones were provided. Lol
Immy I,"Staff: staff were very friendly and pay full attention to your needs. I was constantly checked on (while awake) to see if there was anything i needed. Check-in: there was no issues with check-in. My tickets were checked and bags loaded with no fuss. Food: you are served (in my opinion) a lot of food during the flight. It is nice to look at but not too practical. There is a big deal about setting your porcelain plates with the little porcelain salt and pepper shakers but during times of turbulence, it can be a nuisance. The food itself was tasty and clean. The staff walk around with a buffet style trolley and you pick what you would like to eat. Comfort: this is the most important factor for me. I felt extremely comfortable throughout the journey. The seats fully recline into a bed so you can wake up refreshed. Seat: the seat is large and spacious. You dont feel your privacy is invaded even with another person sat next to you. Entertainment: i have to say the staff were very entertaining themselves but there is a good selection of movies to watch. Overall: having only ever travelled economy, i really saw the difference in class. For such a long journey, it is absolutely worth every penny to invest in comfort and ease which is what i got with business. I will never go back to economy again."
Maruf Subhani,Pia is my homeland airline. Best staff best service plane is very shiny i love my airline must travel with Pakistan international airline
drkbhambha,checkin was swift with courteous staff flight took off on time seats were slightly tight need to improve the space .although flight was full staff was very fast in serving the passengers..breakfast was deliciuos as usual newspaper available staff humble and helpful
sabina_23,"Just came back from lahore Pakistan with three young children going from Heathrow was okay staff were helpful but noting else much going on. Coming back to Heathrow was a horrible experience for the whole family. No screens were working if you were lucky enough to have a tv screen work they don't supply headphones😣. No blankets or pillows were on board so my children were uncomfortable and cold throughout the whole 8 hours flight back. Food was sooo chilli not even I could eat it let alone children, no food option is given so either eat it or starve. Drinks were brought only with dinner. My 8 year old son was sitting next to a old lady who was constantly coughing so kept asking my son to get her water he was told "" you have been 3 times already asking for drinks WE DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN HERE"" even though he explained it's for someone else they didn't give a damn. Staff closed the curtains and sat there throughout the flight gossiping behind if you want something you will need to get up and walk to them. I had two young kids 2 and 4 aswell who were so bored and hungry. Toilets were blocked so with every flush the water was leaking out onto the outside carpet. The whole plane smelt of urine. Staff didn't even bother to go Check. I rang the bell to ask for some drinks for kids but no one came. The call switch is not the PIA staff's concern they just ignore you. My son went up again to get us drinks and was told no your not getting nothing. Useless rude and very lazy staff. Will NEVER travel with PIA again. If they can't run the airplane better just to shut it down and defiantly train your staff on manners and adequate. How to deal with people and maybe crack a smile"
Fleming,I called a PIA contact center to get an information regarding to carry a golf kit but it is regret to have a such situations call hanged up several of times put on hold with out permission and misguided too.It seems that PIA contact center of Islamabad agents have not gone through training to assist the query not this only they have only learned how to get hanged up the call on that condition anyway.Perhaps their supervisor namely Mr.Kashif who is not available the full week whenever i called.To ensure that the provided info was correct i requested to have a email which i can rely so they told me that due to limited excess we are helpless in this regards that was really a big shame to PIA. This is supposed to be my last trip with budget Airline either i would not suggest any one to be a part of PIA at any cost. I would like to mention their names which i got worst experience. 1-Raza 2-Muzammil 3-Hafiz 4-Kazim 5-Zahid and many more.
SOQ2010,"Prior on line checkin not available,(im not aware of it). Carry on bag was weighed along with checkin 2 pieces which go free . Lounge was okay . Priority boarding for business class passengers wasnt adequate.As i entered my seat was allready occupied by a lady (whatever the reason baby ,mental or physical limitation.)it reflected on cabin crews professionalism. Food ,service, cleanliness landing everything was good . , but letting someone occupy your seat left a veryyyy bad impression , authorities should look into it."
flyfisher66,"It was yet another horrible experience. I was going on a hunting trip and was carrying my hunting rifle with some ammo which I have done so many times in the past. The security guys from ASF inspected the weapon and ammo in detail and recorded everything, as per procedure. The PIA receptionist on the counter gave me a boarding pass and said that the weapon will be checked and booked by the guy from security department as per procedure which knew very well. I waited for the concerned guy for a long time but no one turned up. The lady on the counter kept telling me that he is just arriving. After 30 minutes, I contacted the supervisor who showed his inability to do anything more than that as it was time for shift change. People from old shift were leaving and new shift people had not yet arrived. Finally the guy arrived after 45 minutes, and took another 15 minutes to book the luggage. He inspected the weapon & ammo, took his notes and took over my rifle and suite case that carried the ammo in his possession. I had to rush for boarding as I had spent over one hour extra on the counter. The flight went well without any problem. But at Karachi, one of the bags didn't arrive. I contact the lost and found guys who were quite helpful but were unable to contact the concerned people back in Islamabad for more than an hour as no one was picking up. This was horrifying and very non-professional. I informed them again and again that they must get the whereabouts of the bag as it carries ammo. I asked them that weapons and ammo are handled exclusively so how could a bag carrying ammo didn't arrive but they had no reply for this? This was pure incompetence and non-professionalism on part of PIA staff. Finally, after more than 90 minutes of waiting, I was told that my bag has been found and it was taken down from the flight as it carried ammo. I was stunned on this revelation..... I asked them that they inspected everything, recorded it in their record than how could this happen but they had no satisfactory reply for that. My bag arrived next day from Islamabad. A horrifying experience indeed indicating a very irresponsible attitude. My advise for hunters and sport shooters who carry their weapons on air journeys; be very very careful when you are traveling with PIA. You must reach much in advance because they might take a long time in routine procedures. Also make sure that the security guy has done his job, recorded everything and also communicated to all concerned otherwise your bag might be taken down from the flight."
Sadz B,"I always travel with PIA as it goes directly to Lahore and travelling with two young kids is never easy therefore i avoid connecting flights. In the last two years i have travelled four times and i must say the service has really improved. The only downfall has been the broken seats on the plane and the TVs not working. In the past two years all i have ever heard is that sytem was being updated. Imean does it really take two years? There is nothing for the kids. It is not travel friendly at all for young kids. This varies from the food to the entertainment. Although , the service has improved i have decided to travel with Emirates/ Qatar. I think PIA needs to look at Singapore airlines in order to improve that aspect. 7 to 8 hours is a very long time with young kids there needs to be something . And yes we do pay for that service. I think im going to risk the connecting flight."
Nigel A,"Whilst it is true to say that PIA is not in the same league as some other airlines, they seem committed to a programme of continuous improvement which relies on passenger confidence. The flight offered no entertainment, but the seat was comfortable, the service and food good. Give them your support and they will continue to improve."
zeshan7,"Service was rubbish as always the flight was delayed by 2 hours. But we had to sit on the plane for over n hour. In flight entertainment wasn't work as usual, best thing was I got front row seats with plenty of leg room but seats were cramped together. Checking in at MAN AIR was great quick service but luggage claiming at new islamabad airport took ages. Travelling alone i had to wait over n hour for my suitcase. At border control i told the guy"
Rod B,"To be honest, Being a regular flyer with Emirates, I was a bit nervous to catch this internal flight within Pakistan. There was no need. Islamabad’s new airport was a swift passage through to the gate. The flight with PIA was excellent in economy. And I met a wonderful local gent on the flight who happily chatted and shared his magnificent photos of Northern Pakistan, which were simply beautiful. What a wonderful experience."
Raheel Qamar,The service has improved greatly and the staff are very friendly and courteous. There is good entertainment in flight and seats are quite roomy. Overall a good relaxing flight to go to Pakistan. Will recommend to others to fly PIA as well.
Zahir Rahimtoola,"I flew by PIA on an international sector after ages and I was pleasantly surprised with the excellent service, wish the aircraft was in a better condition, I took this flight with great apprehension as there is a lot of adverse publicity however the moment I boarded I was warmly welcomed by the stewardess Huma Wali who was looking after our section. She was extremely courteous and very helpful throughout the flight. The Senior Purser Azhar Khan made sure we were very well looked after and often came over to check on us. I certainly look forward to flying more on PIA."
smallhausen1,"Flight has been operated by ATR turboprop aircraft. Pros: 1. On time performance 2. Smooth check in Cons: 1. Not too much space for hand luggage 2. Not very clean interior 3. Very hard landing There is often no choice on domestic lines, so do not have high expectations"
Sarah,"The ISB-GIL flight has some amazing views and is better than the Skardu flight in this regard. Saw frozen lakes, Snow covered mountains and hidden valleys. The landing was an amazing experience as well. I enjoyed this flight. Only drawback was that our luggage did not all come in."
Hassan A,"Chor hain saalay, and 3rd Class service. Charged 40,000 PKR for 2 extra bags. Which should be only 220$USD according to their website. But Staff asked me to pay 320$ USD. Ran out with USD and paid 220$ USD Plus 140 CAD. So charged me 140$ CAD extra, jo k unki jaib main jaiga. I was flying as a new immigrant and selected that flight because there was enough time 6 hours gap for my connecting flight to Winnipeg, so that I can easily pass immigiration and custum matters, but on last day they have changed the timings of plane, and I got 3 hours of very short period of transit time to get my connecting flight. Aur sonay pe sohaga, they were unable to open the gate for 40 minutes after landing the plane at Torronto due to unknown reasons, 40 minutes yahan per zaya hogaye 2nd plane lenay se pehlay. I was running with my wife and 4 year old son to another terminal... and was nearly thr to miss my flight to Winnipeg... Lesson learned that I will never fly with PIA again ever."
Mark G,Well I am a frequent flyer on PIA due to having the only direct flight between London and Pakistan. The seats need maintained and reupholstered for a long haul flight. The visual display system is a catch. Bring your own entertainment or plan to go to sleep. Staff are always friendly and respectful. You may find you have to swap seats a few times if you end up sitting beside a female due to cultural norms - this is OK if that is the way it is. I am glad I have a FF card to board early.
AJ K,"Yes it is worst airline of the world and being proud Pakistani, i feel bad .. but this is a fact. Our misery started well before our travel date where we were travelling from Australia to KL and then taking PIA to Karachi, so flights were well sync'ed however PIA decided to cancel and move our KL to KHI flight about 5 times, which stuffed up our further itinerary, we had stay in Karachi for couple of days and travelling PIA again to Islamabad, however due to international flight changes, our domestic keep on changing, eventually we had to stay in KL for 2 days to catch PIA flight (which we didnt eventually, read on) but PIA refused to acknowledge any of the issues and told us any other flights are not their concern even domestic PIA because it was our of same PNR (PIA booking dont allow stay for 2 days under same PNR), and to rub more salt on wound, PIA downgraded our flights from Business to Economy WITHOUT LETTING US KNOW! , it is a long story but in summary we ended up changing flights 7 times,ending up changing our hotel booking in Karachi 7 times, and believe it or not, ended up paying for THEIR stuff up in domestic 3 times (about 80K).KL to Karachi was delayed for more then 180 hours and eventually they adjusted us in Thai (no thanks to PIA for that but special thanks to ground staff at KL airport specially shafi sb for their efforts) . We somehow reached Karachi 2 days late and Islamabad 4 days late, on way back i cancelled all of my PIA flights and waiting for refund from them (and yes good luck to me, that will be another review). AVOID THEM AT ANY COST if you are planning to connect to them from any destination, sync'ing just doesnt work for PIA"
DrSafiuddin,"Although had heard a lot of negative reviews about PIA, but we found the flight very comfortable. Seats are very spacious, crew is helpful and polite."
BMKhizar,A Good Airline but need a lot of improvements. The pilots are experienced but the overall system needs to be overhauled.
Ali A,"My Review title says it all, the most atrocious, almost barbaric, cave man style airline in the history of Aviation."
Ayaz B,"first experience to travel on an international route, very comfortable flight, big plane , comfortable seats & best food during the flight, much better then Thai air, direct flight from KL to KHI which save many hours in stopover & connecting flight . flight was also on time,friendly crew"
Fawad Masud,PIA is Good overall but there is a lot than can be done to make it a very good airline. Customer Service needs to be improved definitely. I have heard the staff for international flights is much better than domestic flights. Overall i would love to fly with my own Pakistani Airline.
Lulivo R,i want to share my experience here about very low rated air line PIA .i traveled with PIA accidentally but i found them very professional.
Imran K,"Words cannot describe how awful the service was on this PIA flight (London to Karachi, and also returning to London. Firstly, I ordered vegetarian food several weeks in advance, and this was noted on their system, but no such food was arranged for me on the 7-hour flight. The crew literally could not care less, and offered me a chicken meal, as an alternative! At first they didn't want to even ask their colleagues, but after a long argument, they got me a fee pieces of lettuce, at which point I loudly complained! They then served up some nasty uncooked pastry. Exactly same problem coming back! The seat worn torn and the inflight entertainment system did not work at all on my departing and returning journey - no excuse offered by crew. In my leg space area was a metal box, which reduced my leg space quite a bit. One of the crew members had a bad case of body odour. At Heathrow, the first officer was very rude and uninterested in hearing my complaint. I paid and extra 47,000 rupees (about 280 GBP to extend my flight for 14 days. Overall, my economy flight with the extension cost about 780 GBP).There are no circumstances I would EVER fly PIA again, even though its a direct flight. Horrible airline. Also the staff on the PIA booking line speak awful English and will often put the phone down on you as they cant understand what you are saying."
taquir,The airline rumored to be late was just on time in both departure and arrival. the seats were comparatively better and food was excellent with lot of choices.
veer2808,"Our recent experience with the national airline and flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) got me thinking. Have we become so used to travelling business class on international airlines because all our recent trips have been overseas, that we have become over-demanding? PERHAPS ITS ACCEPTABLE, for a local airliner to be over 3 hours delayed, not owing to weather or other natural causes, and yet not bother to inform passengers? PERHAPS ITS ACCEPTABLE, for an airline to keep its passengers waiting indefinitely with continually extending departure timings without giving any rhyme or reason for the delay. We finally boarded and, contrary to my apprehensions, the rest of the flight was not too bad. Though cramped as is the norm in Economy, the interior was clean and the service very pleasant and efficient. One thing’s for sure - PERHAPS ITS ACCEPTABLE - but if I can help it, never flying PIA again!"
mohammed k,"they have changed the name from business class to economy plus ,they charge for business class seat are broken had to try 5 before I found one that works lucky for me there where only 12 people in that class tv do not work food is sort of ok nowt to shout about toilets where small ,but the staff where very good lucky for me I had my laptop with me they do not have any usb or charging ports for the phone or laptop"
varunaja,"Expect delays and very poor cabin condition. Things seems to be improving, but not up to the world standards."
mohammadzuhirk,"My thoughts was the PIA domestic flight is not good, but this experience changed the picture. Good plane, on time departure, friendly cabin crew, and good service."
Fathila A,"It offered the cheapest flights for the dates we wanted. But our connection flight from Karachi to Heathrow was delayed for more than 24 hours. The staff couldn't give a clear reason for the delay. When they had given us an overnight stay at a hotel, they didn't let us take our checked in lugagges. At least they gave us priority check in the next day. One thing for sure, I can't complain about the airline's food. It's the best I had so far."
k1tyres,I am a business traveler and never in my 35 years of flying experienced such a poor airline. Truly ghastly and the worst experience of my life. Not only did my bags arrive over an hour late being a business class traveler but the ventilation system has caused me to have a chest infection. Islamabad airport VIP lounge only has one toilet which was occupied most of the time. The Pakistani community should boycott the airline and force the service to improve
sbashir786,"Avoid this cowboy airline unless you want to be humiliated and ill treated!!! I was due to travel back from Islamabad to Manchester on 03/09/18. We arrived at the airport to be informed that our flight had been cancelled. We received no prior notice of this. The PIA representative at the counter was extremely rude and dismissive and informed us that the flight had been cancelled due to technical issues. He lied and said they had contacted us via phone and email and when we asked for proof he was unable to provide this. We had confirmed our flights 2 days before at Kotli Azad Kashmir and were not made aware of any cancellations. The PIA agents also informed us that the flight got cancelled the previous evening - I feel this is insufficient notice! He failed to offer us an alternative flight but rather advised us to contact our travel agent and to go home. The PIA agent then walked away from the counter and another agent replaced him. In total we spoke to about 4 PIA agents before someone actually listened to our concerns. None of your agents were wearing name badges and refused to give us their names, one of your agents even started smoking in front of us without being on a break and was on a personal phone call whilst he should have been reassuring his customers. We kept being told to sit and wait. This went on for about 5 hours. Finally, we were offered an alternative flight to London and a later flight for the 07/09/18. We refused these options as London airport is 6 hours away from our home address and the flight for the 7th was too late due to school and work. After hours and hours of raising our concerns, finally we managed to get the agent to agree a flight for 04/09/18 at 11am to Birmingham (our original flight was to Manchester). We were not offered any apology, no compensation or travel fare to get us to a hotel. We travelled 5 hours from our address in Pakistan to get to Islamabad airport only to be disappointed and mistreated. We had used all our money thinking we would be going home on the 3rd September. We had to borrow money from relatives who had come to drop us off at the airport. We had to pay further money to arranged overnight accommodation, food and then the taxi back to the airport in the morning. Also, an expensive taxi from Birmingham to Rochdale (which is a 3-hour journey) I feel absolutely disheartened and extremely upset by the way my family and I were treated by PIA. Their customer service skills are shocking, they have absolute no regard for their customers and needless to say I will NEVER use them again!!"
mydellboy,H aving booked our holiday flights for 5 people with a return fare to kl for £1650 it seemed like a dream. However PIA cancelled the connecting flight from Karachi to kl just one week before departure.Therefore rearrangements had to be made and change of hotel dates be made to allow us to go. Then checking in at heathrow we were then told that we had no Visas and could not get any overnight.With the cancellation we now had to stay 2 nights in Karachi of which required a visa. We were told to sit and wait to see what could be done .We were then informed that we could continue to Karachi and see immigration at Karachi to see if we could be allowed to continue our journey...The dream had turned into a nightmare......never again with PIA.
i2Wander,"Yes, that's what they are - Greedy Liars. We booked tickets at the PIA counter and they confirmed the booking. When the time came to board the plane, they said the tickets are not confirmed and we had to pay twice for two tickets otherwise they did not let us board. We showed them the receipt but ALAS!!! We've been trying to contact their customer service for more than 2 weeks - emailed (on various email addresses they've mentioned on their official website), also called them a crazy number of times but no one has returned back to us. We had to rebook our tickets again and ended up paying thrice the money for no reason. PIA's customer service is RUBBISH (online and offline). We will never again travel with this airline and we will make sure that our friends and family avoid the hassle too!!! Sigh PIA, you just lost a number of potential customers!!!"
Hussainr,"For the first time we had a packed agenda for a trip to Pakistan. Given the amount of miles that we would cover over the next 2 weeks, We choose to fly with the national carrier of Pakistan - PIA. Against all the advice from family and friends, we braved it and managed to find a reasonable price for the flight (still could have been cheaper??). So you could say not a bad start?? However, this also meant that we returned to London Heathrow instead of Birmingham. Again, not a problem just meant we met up with more family and friends. So having booked with a reputable travel agent, the first issue was that we did not have one single booking. The travel agent booked us on 3 different bookings. We did not notice this until after the booking was made. Credit to the agent they managed to secure us 4 seats all together on all flights (or did they??) Birmingham departure - things went smoothly Islamabad arrival and departure (New airport) - all smooth and thumbs up for a new airport although early days as some of the facilities that were not up and running 100% Karachi departure - things went well, as expected. NOW for every single flight PIA had changed all there aircraft. Which meant that we were seated all over the aircraft. No thought given to the original seat numbers or seating requirement. Thankfully we managed to get to the airport early enough to negotiate seating together. Albeit this was a mission in itself. The staff that we dealt with on each of the counters (except Birmingham) found it a chore just being at work let alone be bothered to serve a polite request for seating together. Sadly, this just confirms other reviews of this airline. The flights themselves were below average. The on-board entertainment did not work and on approaching the cabin crew they were honest in there response. Which is satisfactory instead of being spun a line on why things do not work. The food was again average. The assuming thing was that there was 2 adults and 2 children in our travelling party. So how did we manage to get 3 different meals served? The drinks on the other hand were plentiful and water was always available where this has always been an issue on previous flights. The general maintenance of the interior of the aircraft is subject to personal opinions. You may be lucky to get a sat that actually, works i.e. reclines or you may get an automatic chair that reclines without any intervention from the occupier (simply put the seat is broken). Unfortunately, this is never a good formula especially if the person sitting behind you knows better than you and is not willing to understand. In general, you travel with PIA with your eyes wide shut. The 3 stars are because we managed to overcome most of the hurdles that we were faced with. I guess the other point is, yes PIA deliver a below than average service but it takes 2 to tango and passengers also have a level of responsibility."
Zee,"Disgusting service, hugely overpriced, horrible moody and rude flight attendants and airport staff. No in-flight entertainment but they still give you crap headphones, what are you supposed to do with them. Hardly any pillows or blankets. They change your direct return flight to via Karachi without informing you because they are deliberately over booking. People need to boycott PIA and then see how things quickly change. If you've never flown via the middle east on one of the other airlines then do, you probably won't go back to PIA again."
Saad K,"The airline isn't known for latest jets or superior service, but it was on time. For my trip, the most appealing aspect for choosing PIA was that it was the only airline plying directly between Karachi and Kuala Lumpur. Thus, the trip took only six hours, which is way better than the available alternates with at least one layover. Moreover, food was good."
ntyze ,"Well, I should have realised buying cheap tickets was a bad idea. Let me say if you're thinking about it. Don't do it. Nothing will prepare you for the mess and uncoordinated horror that is Pakistani airports and airlines. Planes are hard leased from old Vietnam airlines. Every screen in the economy class was broken or made not to work, even the screen just flashed ""Vietnam airlines"" over and over. I remember flying the same model plane from when I was 9 years old. I am 29 now. The side effect of little to no entertainment is kids going pretty much rampant the whole entire time. I tried upgrading and they wouldn't let me. Food is pretty horrible - not abysmal, but not amazing either. One meal made me sick - I had to navigate to my destination and have stomach problems for the first 2 days of my trip. My baggage was lost once and put on a domestic flight. Every plane was delayed by hours. I was stuck in Islamabad for 13 hours. I had to change plane because ours broke down, so couldn't stay on. This made me have to go through the airport to change and the alcohol that I had checked in previously was taken away from me, about £100 worth. I had little chance to explain this to a guy with a gun what the situation was nor did anyone from the airline really help out. PIA staff were generally just overworked. Nothing to complain about on the flight re the staff except the above, I'd be annoyed too if I worked for PIA. There is talk they want to revamp their fleet and integrity. Good luck with that using 30-year-old planes. I can't see this happening ever."
ahmadalam,"I have to fly (don't have a choice in the matter) with these folks nearly every year, and the experience is either just tolerable, or bad, it's just never good. With the videos and photos I have taken, I will eventually, if I have the time, write a blog on this. Here's a brief list of my recent experiences:- Entertainment systems turned off with screens flashing for seven hours, so no chance of sleep, that the staff won't or can't turn off completely. Taken care of by shoving a safety card over it. The boxes for these are under the often under the seats, so restrict the already meagre leg room. If you're lucky, the screens are off, or it's crashed showing you a Linux command line screen with the Linux Penguin in the corner. The ramshackle seats, nearly all worn or broken in some way, a cup holder that won't close, a snapped off edge of table etc. Food, tiny portions of food, that isn't actually usually that bad. But it's put luck, the breakfast on my recent flight was more like some form of pre-mummification ritual for the passengers, every item was dryer than the next, so much so it felt like was stuffing some form of dehydration pastry into my mouth and eventually gave up. That's just an example. Insects in various tray items, a whole fly was embedded in the wrapping along with my plastic fork. Oh and bookings? Change a ticket date and they'll do something clever, they'll quote you a price. So you go on your flight day, and they'll just deny that price and set you a new higher one. If you argue, they'll tell you sit and wait. When you realise the dirty game their playing, and that they want you to panic as the check-in will close soon, you then ask again, and they now raise the price even higher, they managed get to £80 out of doing this the last time I needed a change. It all about squeezing every last bit of cash they can from you. Here's a good one, I need to leave the country early so turned up ready to pay to do so. So they had the seats, but quoted an exorbitant price, however if I came back the next day, it would be 1/3 the price. They were banking on it being too difficult for me to come back to the airport, but miscalculated as another day for the three of us was not an issue, we elected for the following day. However, the next day it turns out the re-issued tickets were wrong, they'd made two for me, and one for one of the other passengers, ignoring the third. This was fixed after a fashion, but not before rebuking me for not paying attention when buying the tickets, odd considering I handed over the three the day before to be modified for the present date, to a PIA official; it was his mistake. In flight it's pot luck, you can have polite cabin crew, and on one occasion I even had a good conversation with one. But it's become progressively worse to the point of crew being openly hostile. It is after all the flag carrier of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, so one would think that praying wouldn't be an issue. If one can stand, for ten times the amount of time it takes pray, outside one of their dirty (they nearly always are) toilets, then praying for a few minutes isn't a safety issue or anything, KLM (their staff praised me for observing my religion quietly!) and Emirates don't mind. However on a recent trip what looked like chief purser became extremely hostile and angry, and when I said KLM didn't mind he shouted back 'well fly KLM then!'. It is hate an anger that he had to a simple request that shocked me, and with a few flights to Britain, I was flying back home too) having been escorted by fighter jets/diverted due to passengers/staff arguments over the past few years, I decided to quietly pray sitting in my seat and avoid the crew. My knee was rammed by a host's trolley later in that flight in what appeared to a deliberate act of retaliation, it left my leg so sore that when I took a photo of the swelling a day later it was still visible, but realised that any action against them would just be a waste of time. Oh check-in? This incident I reported to Manchester Airport, they palmed it off saying, tell the airline, which meant give up. My wife has a bad back, and usually needs assistance in lifting her suitcase onto the check-in conveyor belt. However I went to park the car whilst my wife queued. On returning I asked the chap manning the head of the check-in queue if I can help my wife, he was the same demographic as me, born to Pakistani parents, but Rochdale/Bury accented, yes I know the difference, he told me stand aside, and wait, so I said in exasperation, 'ok so you want to interview me, fine', and waited. After some time when I asked if I could help now that my wife was now at the check in desk he said no, 'I'm banned then?', I asked, he goes yes. So I asked him where his station manager was, and he pointed to him, so I went and asked him. The chap stood there and listened, but looking past me into the distance, this is part of a dehumanising trait common in Pakistan if someone has more influence, social status, and/or money than you. To experience it in Britain was quite disgusting. He eventually said I could go and help, I thanked him and went. Now I was just being polite and at airports if you're certain type of person, largely based on skin colour, one needs to be extra cautious. I could have just gone around form where people were exiting with no issue. Now I if I need to be there to help a relative, I just print off an extra ticket, as the chap or chapess manning the head of the queue can't check a tickets validity, and in my case it was a chap with a Napoleon complex, a receptionist who thinks he own the building. There's so much more, but this will do to tell any hapless traveller, avoid this airline at all costs, pay extra, and travel Emirates for example, I did for the first leg of my journey with them and it was quite good. Don't bother with Etihad, they code share with PIA!"
HARAM N,"Check in and boarding was easy.takeoff was ok.food was egg and 4 chicken pieces , jam and butter.I dont know why there tea makes me sleep.landing was poor.but what I am frustrated about is that my carton is lost.i asked them but they were so rude that they said to only register a complain.only a complain . In that carton were important things like meat. Please tell me something that to do. this is not the first time its happening."
Thair Ayub,"A terrible experience. It was worse than what I was warned about this airline. Nothing works, the entertainment screens do not work and have been out of order for over a decade. This brought about great disruption on the flight. Kids were screaming, crying and shouting and also just running all over the place I’m sure a working entertainment system would take care of this chaos. The attendants were absolutely shattered. The food was absolutely disgusting."
kgurmani,Everybody says that PIA the national flag barrier of the country is not delivering what it was famous for in the past. The Flight is no doubt the worst now because of many reasons. No communications between the service providers and the customers if in case it is delayed. The flight attendants are much tired because of the unrealistic schedule by the airlines. The aircrafts are not up to date. The service centers don't provide any information regarding the issues. The food was amazing.
Henrique G,Average in every regard. I've flown with them several times and never had an issue. I did appreciate the Captain allowing us to enter the cabin to see K2 on or way to Skardu.
b_town87,"I travel 3 to 4 times a year on various air lines. Never experienced anything like this, quite easy to understand why pia is so disliked. No communication when flights are delayed, refuse to speak to customers when wanting to know more information, hang up when you call their call centre. For some reason the pia employees pretty much most but not all, seem to think they are doing their customers a favour, very strange mentality. Surprised they still operate!"
HARAM N,Flight was delayed for nothing. Boarding was ok Customer service was ok with air staff extermely tired. Food was ok. The aircraft was dirty. Flight attendants were tired because of the schedule.
urstilful,"Absolutely pathetic customer service, flight delays are the norm. No inflight entertainment. Poor food quality. Absolutely irresponsible behaviour when it comes to communicating major flight rescheduling and delays to the passengers without any regard for how it could impact their work/ plans. Did I mention absolutely terrible customer service?"
mr t,total horror. there is NO in flight entertainment for last 5 years now. always feels like plane will drop out of sky. decor is old and disgusting. there arw small children jumping up and down on the plane wing seats the whole journey. there are no blankets also and passengers fight about blankets. you see all the interior shaking to pieces also disaster just waiting to happen.
mhbalghari,"great people to fly with PIA. On time the crew is friendly ,the food is very good food and the captain landed very nicely and than from Islamabad to sakardu i travel with pia which is great experience . I recommended the air line to friends and family GREAT PEOPLE TO FLY WITH PIA"
acpsa452,"Flight got delayed twice in a row, maybe it was due to bad weather. Anyhow, overall experience of PIA is not that bad."
Waheed Zafar,"Although it has no bells and whistles but has the shortest travel time food service on trolleys with lovely choices delicious. Most importantly it costs around £1300 as opposed to others airlines charging £3000 to £4000 ,for same route and much poor food choices. I am happy to buy drinks and watch movie on my laptop mobile if I can buy tickets at less than half price"
badarulislam961,"i'm writing email been last 35 days and did not get any response from them because even they don't want to look there work(i believe). I book my ticket 4th June cancel on 5th June and as per PIA policy i should get money back within 15 to 20 days, don't you believe that still i'm waiting for that. i know that i have done mistake to book ticket and i think its enough to be patient. i'm sure even they don't care about reviews but i would keep writing until i will not get my money back."
Oliver T,"My flight from Lahore to london was not the best, but to be honest I didn’t care that much, but the thing I was really upset was that in my food there was a hair!! I told the air hostesses about it and they didn’t care much, they told me it was unacceptable and they will write it down in the logbook, but no claim papers. This company is a total joke. I will never flight with them again"
Farooq S,"Traveled from Dammam to Islamabad a couple of times during this year. There is nothing impressive about their service. The staff is reasonably well trained but the planes are old and the seats are highly uncomfortable. The only good thing was their direct flight service and comparatively better fares. They have a strange policy of no infant baggage allowance from Islamabad to Dammam sector, dont understand the reason for doing this."
Omer.RON,"Flight was on time. PIA Management confirms the departure time via sms hours ahead from departure. In case of delay, some one can manage. Good Fares and excelelnt meals. Keep it up PIA , we love you :)"
Faisal B,"I travelled to Pakistan on PIA in Business class ( i got a free upgrade!) And the service was impeccable. The crew were down to earth, very friendly and helpful. They ensured our journey was tailored to our specific needs even though we didn't ask for much but seriously in all honesty the service was great as compared to what the critics say. The food was amazing and overall the journey was a smooth one and time passed fairly quickly. The seats were comfortable and relaxing as well. I would highly recommend flying with this airline especially to a beautiful country, Pakistan. The nature and culture and the beauty that the nation boasts is of very special importance. There are many places to visit to enjoy the richness of culture and relaxation from the high mountain top settlements in Murree to the bustling streets of Lahore (Food Street)! Amazing country and national flag carrier of it."
warytraveller2018,My flight was manchester to Lahore via Islamabad. There was a few hours to wait at Islamabad for the connecting flight. The flight was constantly cancelled or delayed then started again. This happened all day till 11-12 hours later. Nobody bothered to let us know what was happening or what we could do. We were not helped at all by PIA for proper meals or refreshments or a hotel. When we asked for a refund the desk clearkbtold is to go into the city and get a agent to sort it. This was 1800 hours. We had arrive there at 0800 hours ! Our plane took off at 1030-1100 hours. It was an absolute joke. We later realised the plane had been deliberately kept waiting so other passengers could arrive ALL DAY! We had just been led on all day with the desks stories and lies. They did not treat us right. They inprisoned us and let us suffer. They should not be allowed to do this.
AliJouhar,"Dirty n damaged seats with chocolate wrappers inside seats pockets left from preceding flight... On Flight Air Hostess were grnerally found non-welcoming, rude, unpolite and lazy."
Imti Y,I am a frequent flyer mostly from london to Islamabad and been regularly flying 5/6 times a year from last 20 years In my opinion PIA staff is doing their best to provide good service. Flight leaves arrives pretty much on time. Inflight facilities are bit poor but it's not staff fault at all. It's the airline responsibility to provide good food/ entertainment/ passenger comfort supplies. We shouldn't blame the staff they will offer what they were provided. They can not bring qeema/allo parathas/pillo blanket from their homes to supply to passengers. I found air crew very helpful and cooperative through out the flight. But we have some stubborn and mooning passenger who compare our flights with emirates and eitehad. No one is forcing them to use PIA.
Asad H,"Good direct night flight. Food moderate, inflight entertainment screen was not working. Overall average."
Vikan K,"We were traveled in group from Thailand about 28 people from Isalamabad to Gilgit on May 27th, 2018. We planned to travel up north to the China border in Khunjerab for another 3 days. The flight was pleasant but it ended up that about 10 people in out group did not get their luggages. Some of us could get their luggages the next day but not three still could not and one person could not get until the end of the trip (5 days trip). How awful and even worse that the airline did not take any responsibility. No compensation as per applicable convention or law as it said on the airline information. Not even the word of apology! If you plan to fly this airline I suggest you to carry-on your baggage or at least prepare some needy items with you."
imasadkhan4,Excellent service Some of the local flights in world who serve time related food stuff free of cost
azhar443,"I figure I'll just mention my experience in point form below which sums it up accurately: - 2 hours delayed in Toronto with no staff updates or explanation - ripped and stained leather seats (my wife's seat didn't recline) - entertainment system didn't work on most biz seats - no ammenity kits - business meals were served out of aluminum trays, no concept of presentation, culinary innovation or experience - blankets that were distributed were sprayed with cheap air freshener, they weren't wrapped in plastic so they were likely recycled from the inbound flight - the only redeeming point was the use of the KLM lounge in Toronto which was decent"
Oktay İ,"I am a frequent traveler, I have used many airlines including budget airlines Wow air, Wizz Air, Ryanair and so on but PIA is the worst of all. The plane is dirty, old, smells bad, crappy food (only one option) and it was late for 50 minutes. I will never use this airline again"
Mask Girl x,Was utterly disserpointed to have sat on such an airplane the airplane itself is filthy and very old. Looks like it will crash. The flight attendants are rude nothing compared to Emirates economy class if you are going to Pakistan or anywhere and PIA is an option dont choose it you will be disappointed
bilahm2,So much better than what i had been told or expecting.. I usually sleep through my flights and had three seats in business to myself.. Would never take pia on a long haul.. But a three hour flight was not too uncomfortable.. Plus it was nice to fly my national carrier..
Arsalan Mansoor,"No entertainment even though screens are installed, won't give you head phones. Don't understand the logic of that. Food is poor and next to nothing offered. The only decent thing is the people, who are very sweet and kind from the entry into the airport."
bal00mna,"First, my flight was 9pm but i'm bot sure which airport to depart. After I checked i found out that my flight were canceled without imforming. I got a new flight at5pm. Theb postpone to 7pm and yeah again postpone to 10pm. Postpone 3 times in a row. Never onboard with them again. Staff was terrible, she make me feel like she don't want to come to work. So sick."
Immad A,"First of all, as an aviation Enthusiast, I was very happy with the plane as it was my favorite one,Boieng 777-240ER.The cabin crew was quite friendly. I wasn't expecting this but they really have improved much. Go PIA!"
Babar W,"seats were very good and comfortable and service is much improved, polite and friendly staff and it was on time"
Rubab Daha,"We were not expecting our experience to be this great. We went with no expectations but received the best service. I had always heard and read negative feedback but our experience was totally opposite.It was a Hajj flight and we traveled on 14th August 2017. They served us these mini cakes with Pakistan flag on it. i am sharing the picture here. Staff was extremely helpful and courteous. On our way back from Saudi, I asked the air hostess that why were they not serving meal and she said that ""Ma'am most of the passengers are sleeping and we would rather wait than disturb their sleep"" They waited and then served an excellent meal."
Anila94,"Our flight from Birmingham to Islamabad went smoothly, but the experience with staff was terrible! The check in desk was fine. When we got on the plane, we were welcomed nicely, but when the flight had taken off, the staff had taken a totally different turn. They walked around with a frown on their faces and were not professional at all. The seats were average, not exactly comfortable for a 7-8 hour flight.. As a person that suffers from travel sickness, I always stay away from the food they offer. The air host offered me dinner and I refused politely. The same air host started to serve breakfast in the morning and started forcing me to have the breakfast when I had clearly refused! Was not happy at all about that... The last 4 hours of the flight was a nightmare, my travel sickness had kicked in. There were no sickness bags on the seats close to me, and I didn't have a decent bag of my own. My father went to ask for a bag and told them there were none at our seats.They clearly refused saying that there are bags at the seat and didn't give us a bag. They saw that I was very unwell and didn't help at all! Baggage claim at Islamabad is like always, crazy! We waited a good 2 hours for our bags and then realised they changed the belt without informing anyone.. It only gets worse from here.....Never again PIA!"
Frankel18,"DO NOT BOOK!! The service and flight was what I can only describe as horrendous. Some of the female staff and one in particular had such a poor attitude as though she didn’t want to be there, she was rude and unhelpful. The plane was one of the really old ones that have like card board seats, uncomfortable and clearly not fit for a long haul flight. If only PIA had more competition by way of alternative flights offered by other providers maybe that would make them pull their act together. In the 20th century I would expect updated seating and facilities on the plane with staff that have manners, a trolly of food and drinks people can purchase from is the very basic one would expect on a long haul flight and is offered by many airlines but not PIA if you’re lucky they will come around with a bottle of water filling up a tiny paper cup for you! The food is disgusting and I’m surprised that it meets health and safety standards! I couldn’t wait to get off the flight and can assure PIA I will never be traveling with them again. The amount of money you pay to book a seat with PIA will not meet basic expectations or satisfactory level of service, don’t waste your money try to book with an alternative airline!!"
Aruff K,Travelled PIA after 14 years and it seemed like i sat on exactly the same plane. Nothing had changed! the screens were not working then and were not working this time. The hospitality was poor and they encouraged everyone to sleep for most the flight by switching the lights off. A forgetful experience!
nchammmer,"Smooth flight, busted seats, no onboard flight entertainment systems, however really unprofessional stewardesses whose follies provide live entertainment. Would fly again due to lack of choice and if it saves time. They have a terrible rewards program!"
kemcolian,The flight was delayed upfront by one hour and then left even later; but at least it was not as bad as some of the colleagues and friends narrate on other routes traveling very recently
AqeelAhmad,"It was a direct domestic flight from ISB to CJL and upon arriving in Chitral, we found out that our checked luggage did not arrive. After several attempts of asking/begging/requesting the PIA staff at Chitral airport, they called Islamabad and told us that our luggage was offloaded and will arrive in the next flight (5 days later). That is on the day, we were scheduled to fly back. They refused to do anything about it. The most horrible vacation of my life followed. Later we found out, it happens routinely on this flight."
muzaffarkarim,"the only best part of this flight was a direct-journey from karachi to Toronto, approx 14 hours flight. the legroom was usually, but there was no inflight entertainment as majority of the screens in the plane were not working. the staff was polite but the food served was not tasty at all and the quantity was less for such a long flight. the cleanliness of the washrooms was compromised. only good for elderly, as its a direct flight."
Riz Van H,"Have good airplanes and flight schedules and itineraries. Food is also above average compared to many others. Can improve a bit on Courtesy level, and customer support focus of the staff and food quality and options."
notacanada,"Within 1 month I flew 5 times with PIA. This was the most unexpected, fun and crazy flight. Once in the air, women were offered flower bracelets and bangles, men a little black box. Ladoos were passed around while movie tunes were blaring and male passengers were dancing in the aisles. I was the only non Pakistani on the flight and did feel the time pass that I had to disembark!"
notacanada,"The flight was preboarded with 75% of the passengers which did not leave much room in the upper luggage compartments. Video/wifi could not be watched. After standing in line for 3.5 hours without being able to check in, we were told that the lounge would be open and refreshments served, 1.5 hours later. I had to go once more through security though the lounge was past the control line. When the check-in at last opened there was a rush with angry people jumping lines, it took another 2 hours and then I had to carry my suitcase to another counter as the luggage belt was not working. The plane was delayed by over 3 hours and no explanation was given. One of the flight attendant should not have been in passenger service. On the + side it is the only airline with direct flights from Toronto to Lahore and the luggage allowance is of 28 kg versus 23 kg for most airlines"
Lordyousaf,Use to be the best. The management is a disgrace who don’t do enough to keep the entertainment in plane working. Most staff are great some still need educating how to serve the travelers.
Maher Ihsan U,"not worth at all , broken seats, broken seat recliner button, broken phone charge plugs, smelly blanket , worse food ,acutely noting good with PIA but the crew was very nice and helpful and if you complain about suff they nicely with beautiful smile say they are praying and hope it will get better . it make me feel really sad why our crook vulture leaders did this our nation airline which one time was the best airline."
NottsTTravel,"I have heard in the past that PIA used to be a top airline company but sadly my last 2 trips have been extremely disappointing. I traveled with PIA couple of years ago visiting my family and despite the price the service was just bad so I travel with Emirates. Recently again reluctantly booked PIA from London to Karachi and the same old staff. Not even a smile or thank you. Asked for headphones for the screens and the stewards just said ohh they don’t work, not even apologised, asked for coffee with breakfast the lady said to ask the other steward on board. None arrived so asked for tea and was told the service was over and I should get some at the airport. My mistake for not sticking to Emirates but this is it no more PIA for me. Kind of sad because PIA is our national carrier but it is just bad service and aggressive staff on board."
Ken_doll_dubai,"I always heard about PIA negative feedback, but I was truly surprised with experience i had, I must say staff was extremely customer focused, polite and take good care of passenger, food was great and service was perfect , I am myself working in hospitality field on manager lever and to be honest they were trying their best to make their passengers happy , I had flight Steward Arif who was such a great guy and was taking care of me during all my flight, To the management I must say you guys are really getting way way better please keep it up and make it more better and let’s make it one of the best airline in the world Good Luck Best Regards Adnan Zafar"
Nasra S,"Paid £400 extra for business class. Seats were broken, it was relatively full. Moved seats but that was broken too. Food and service were good cabin crew very attentive. Return flight seats were fine but business class was full. My sister and her husband were booked on economy class but both were seated in business class as plane was full. Other passengers too. So was very annoyed when we had paid extra and they got the same service as us for the price of economy class!!"
JHUSOM,"When it comes to Pakistan International Airlines, a lot of people, including locals and foreigners, are skeptical to consider it as a travelling option. Usually, majority of people opt for it after they've exhausted other alternatives and need to meet certain deadlines. To be honest, I felt really sad after making these observations. If I talk about my most recent flight with PIA, I have nothing but praise for this airline. My flight was right on time, the staff was super courteous, food served wasn't bad at all and our captain was able to get clearance from air traffic control to fly via the direct route which meant that we reached our destination earlier than scheduled. The pilot was amazing as he made sure to congratulate a passenger bride on our plane and wish her well for her life ahead. One downside might have been the plane being a little old. As an old passenger who's traveled via this airline multiple times before, I have to admit that the standard might have fallen in recent years owing to a few accidents, depletion of fleet, lack of addition of brand new planes to the fleet and diminishing operational costs. But yes, there is no doubt that Pakistan International Airlines has some of the best pilots and technical staff in the world. I can only hope and pray that PIA can regain that lost trust amongst its loyal passengers and progressively become the airline of choice for most people travelling locally, as well as abroad."
sajjadhussain2018,Flight was in time. In flight comfort was great if compare to other local air lines Pakistan International Airline is an excellent option if you want to travel within country with rich experience & pioneer airline
FrenchTraveller001,"In January 2018, I was denied boarding my PIA KBL-ISB flight connecting to ISB-CDG because PIA hadn't informed me that I needed a Pakistani visa between 2 international connecting flights in Islamabad -which is not the case anywhere else in the world. In Kabul, PIA refused to re-route me on another airline, which any other airline would have done. I therefore had to buy a new ticket back to Paris on a different airline. I was then told by the PIA Afghanistan country manager who I met face to face that he had let all PIA offices in the world know that they should inform passengers with international transfers in Islamabad that they ought to hold a Pakistani visa. I was not made aware of this when I bought my ticket at the PIA office in Paris and was even told at the time that I didn't need a visa when I asked the question. Once I returned back home, I wrote to the PIA France country manager to ask for a refund of the new ticket I had purchased. After having chased him during a month, the latter replied to me that it was not PIA’s responsibility, which I found a totally unacceptable way of dealing with business class passengers. I then escalated the issue to PIA in Islamabad. A senior customer relations officer replied to me that he would investigate. I chased him twice and have not heard back from him 6 weeks later. This way of behaving with business class passengers is totally unacceptable from an airline. PIA should be ashamed of themselves."
crystals001,"Booked a ticket to Islamabad on business class. I normally travel on an alternative airline, Mum was Not well back in Pakistan so decided to go direct on the good old PIA. I Wasn’t expecting Singapore airline service! After all it’s PIA! Cut the chase it’s meal time, and the lights come on in business class (by the way only 2 passengers in BC). I noticed something moving on the seat next to me, maybe tired eyes or fatigue... NOT! It was 2 cockroaches! I immediately pulled out the good old iPhone, after powering it I started to record the sordid creatures having a field day crawling around the seats! Called the half sleepy air stewardess 👩‍✈️ and told her the problem, she said she will call the captain... Captain? (Unless he was an expert on cockroaches!). Anyway the captain turned up with a button missing from his shirt! (He did have his tie on), I showed him the footage of the cockroaches as they had disappeared Into the depths of the seat. He asked me to change seats and apologised. I wrote of To PIA complaints adding the footage of the horrid creatures. To date I have only received one automated email “we have received your complaint and someone shall be in touch with you”. 5 months and several emails to them... NO RESPONSE. SHAMEFUL and disgusting at the least. By the way none of the inflight entertainment was operational on the aircraft. Avoid... like a Plague."
Dastageer,"It was airbus A320 jet, my travel was one way, when I set on seat it was too hard, I felt the seat without cushions. I think now a days no body can imagine a airline seat can be hard as like this. The plan was very old and need a lot of improvement, even though staff was trying to smile and welcome the passengers. Thank God the distance was only 1:45 minutes otherwise it was difficult to travel. There was nothing to entertain the passengers, last year I travelled to Malaysia in a local airline there was TV with channel's for passengers. The food quality was OK. I travelled with this airline only because time was suitable. My next trip with was an other airline. A big difference between PIA and other airline."
201nadeemm,Flight from Chicago to LAX and connecting from LAX to OGG. Seats are uncomfortable . They charge you for everything from watching TV to any snacks. Staff rude. Wait before they will start charging you for the overhead bin to store your personal belongings and slide your credit card to use the bathroom
SA312,"PIA is mostly used by overseas Pakistanis when travelling to Pakistan because it is the only airline to fly directly there. As is with any airline, faults can arise. Examples that occurred on my latest flight were . Check-In can only be done at the airport for International flight, not online (Other airlines do the same too for international flights) . In-flight entertainment did not work on my seats on the outbound journey (It has happened on carriers like BA,Saudi, RJ for me) . Delays - (Unavoidable on any airline) The point of this is that simply calling PIA bad because such things happen is unfair. That being said there are issues that need to be addressed e.g. . If the flight is delayed as mine was do not just contact the Pakistani number on the booking, also e-mail the customer . If a flight is delayed, a reconfirmation of the seats should not be required That being said buying my tickets online was easy enough once I had all the information required e.g. Passport Number, Visa Number. There should be an option to allow you to input the information later. Check-in on the outbound journey to Lahore was easy as our luggage was not overweight. Boarding was done in reverse order which made the process easier than normal. I was pleasantly surprised at seeing how much legroom there was. Being tall boarding planes of late has been a pain, especially with certain airlines continually reducing their legroom (I'm looking at you BA). I was overjoyed that I had ample legroom on a long haul flight. The food was good. There was also the option of non-spicy food for children however my children took one look and chose the traditional meal instead. Customer service from the attendants was good, which made my flight a pleasure. Based upon my experience on PIA I will definitely use them again. P.S: On an unrelated note sometimes the behaviour of Pakistani passengers can be appalling. The way they address the staff is embarassing. A little bit of respect can go a long way. Why if you want to adhere to all the rules when living in the UK do you throw all that away and regress into uncivilised behaviour."
mojad1975,Took a flight with PIA what a nasty experience never again staff are rude the food is nasty. People line up to use the toilets but only to smoke in them. The airport on the other end it's like a zoo sorry that's me being unfair to animals. The staff at the airport are only after money and what they can get out of you never again
AKK2050,It is not that I did not want to fly with PIA but it is the destinations I flew where PIA did not fly and could not provide a direct non stop connection. I always had fly a foreign airline and waste so much of time in lay over. Now I flew straight to Karachi in 6 hours and it was like home to home and door to door journey. Left on time and arrived on time. Food was great but disappointed to see Indian movies on the entertainment menu. Please put your own movies especially that we all liked from 70s and 80s. Service was impeccable and I was truly impressed. The uniform is beautiful especially with their genuine smile. Please again to New York and LA so we can fly with you. You have our support as our national airline. Well done and Good Job to all.
Saema S,I have been travelling with PIA for the past few months on monthly basis. The condition of their aircrafts are becoming worst. The service they are providing is very bad. food quality is going down day by day.
Uzma K,"Please read if you are disabled and thinking to fly with PIA As a disabled passenger who is fully dependant on my wheelchair and suffering from Multiple Sclerosis I chose to fly with PIA thinking I would be in good hands. I made several calls to the airline to make it evident I would require leg room as my medical condition requires me to keep my legs levitated when I am sitting for extensive time periods and I was advised this information would be noted and I would have priority when boarding the plane. Unfortunately, this was not the case when I arrived at Heathrow Airport. To my disappointment I was told children have priority and there was no note of me calling several times to request and ensure this information was noted. My flight to Pakistan was not only uncomfortable but I was in extreme agony which did not help my condition. There was no remorse or any sympathy shown by the crew at the time and I am very disappointed that I chose to fly with PIA. My stay in Pakistan will now be filled with distress and anxiety as I am now extremely apprehensive to return to the UK on PIA but now that I have booked a return flight I will need to endure this painful experience again. I am very upset and stressed about the fact my medical condition was ignored and not taken into account by PIA. I felt I had been discriminated against for my medical condition and feel as if I was an inconvenience for being in a wheelchair and choosing to fly. I should not have been made to feel like this because of my medical condition and I feel as if I need to take this further to ensure other disabled passengers are aware of the painful experience they will endure if they choose to fly with PIA."
umarkayani ,"In my previous review of PIA you will see how annoying the booking process was and that I had given up on any plans to go. A few days later my Father-in-Law got us some reasonably priced tickets from somebody he knew and off we went. Check-in at Heathrow Staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. They were efficient and got us sorted in next to no time even though we checked in over 100KG of luggage. The check-in experience had a very homely feel as opposed to the highly professional/formal service you get from Emirates etc but was nice in its own way. Flight London- Isb The flight was surprisingly pleasant and homely with competent staff who were clearly enjoying themselves and providing a fantastic service given their limited tools. There was lots of banter between them on who providing the better service and working hardest which translated into a cheery and efficient service. The staff took time to play with my baby daughter and there was a sense of community on the flight which was really nice and gave me a good positive Pakistani experience after all the headache I had previously encountered. Only qualms were that they didn't have enough bassinets and I ended up giving mine away to somebody who needed it a lot more than I did and that the entertainment system wasn't working but if they had both of these things then I don't think I would have had the pleasant community experience that I did. On arrival in Islamabad, it was the same experience that I've been getting since childhood with the same old shuttle bus, gaumless passport control staff, those annoying porters and waiting around an hour for my luggage which did make me shout at a couple of airport staff but they've heard it all before so you just have to grin and bear it as its part of the experience. Isb to London Checkin was surprisingly easy and the airport staff even loaded suitcases on to the luggage belt. On the downside, you get searched, bags scanned etc way too often but we made it through to the departure lounge quickly enough and the flight left bang on time. The flight was OK and the entertainment system was working too. We arrived back to a very busy Heathrow but it was a pleasant trip overall. PIA is never going to be an Emirates as they have a monopoly on the route being the only direct flight to/from Pakistan but so long as they keep things at this standard as a minimum then it's bearable as flying Emirates, Etihad, Turkish, Qatar etc takes significantly longer with all the connections etc. The food wasn't brilliant but nobody expects a Jamie Oliver or Gordon Ramsey inspired meal on PIA."
trip p,"i travelled with pia from LHR to ISB a couple of weeks ago. Flight was on time , checkin was proper and on time. Seats of 786 are comfortable but costomer services and food are just average. If you need adirect flight then its good but not as much comfortable as many others are."
201nadeemm,Flight from Karachi to Islamabad. Staff pleasant and welcoming. Service was great. The captain keep us updated as the Islamabad airport was closed due the traffic. Plane left on time and did get at the destination on time. This is much better experience than a few years ago when I flew from Paris to Islamabad. I am pleased that they have made some changes to improve the service
riahmad,"Its the usual story, poor service, indifferent attitudes, disrespect towards passengers and finally the impressive ""Don't care"" attitude with constant defense of ""all lies"". The new addition is massively delayed flights with no up to date information to passengers. Infact nobody wants to take the ownership of any problem and brilliantly causing misery to the passengers. I can continue with stories for hours but its not worth it and in a nut shell I would advice to take the risk nationally and internationally on your own. I have tried both ends and remain extremely disappointed. The cleanliness id sickening and unfortunately so is the food quality. Very Disappointed repeatedly !!"
Dubai T,"I was traveling to Islamabad from DXB all the time I'm flying with Emirates Airlines butt it was fully booked no seats available then I found seat in PIA and i done big mistake ever in my life to them, nothing was perfect too much smell inside even it was not easy to take breath, I'll never travel with them again and i'll not recommended to anyone be aware with PIA Pakistans Third Class Airline. Not Recommended"
donnie1965,"My flight was Malaysia to London via Karachi for a 4 hour transit. On check in I told the PIA staff I wanted my bag sent to the correct aircraft both at KL and again at Kurachi.... they laughed and told me there would be no problem and that my bag would be at Heathrow on the same flight as me. Heathrow and I'm told my bag is currently in Lahore and will be another 24 hours before it can be placed into a flight to London Heathrow. 2 weeks later I receive my bag; it's been opened and now has a yellow plastic security tag keeping it sealed... there are no documents to say why my TSL met padlock has been removed (and missing). I discover several items missing from within my bag which include a decent set of headphones; 2 x micro memory cards (64 gb and 16gb) and a pair of branded sunglasses (not fake). Two packets of tobacco were also missing (100 grand total). Now I fully understand there are numerous agencies involved in the movement of my bag between KL and Heathrow, but,,,,,, if I hadn't gotten on PIA flight then I wouldn't have lost my bag in the first place; it being sent to another destination opens up the possibility of it being opened with authorisation and items stolen from that bag...... these items were well packed and to find them would mean someone ransacking my bag. I wouldnt go near PIA again; I was told not to use them by several friends and I should have listened to that advice. The customer service was disgraceful and ultimately I ceased all contact with them with regards to my stolen items.... at the time I returned home after 3 years travel due to personal family circumstances which on its own was stressful. Lesson learnt......"
Arslan K,"Please save yourself the trouble of flying with these guys, a donkey and a cart would be more comfortable. i do not know where to start, Food is horrible, stewards and stewardesses were snobbish, flight was delayed and seats were horrible."
Rashid A,"In time flights, improved customer service, direct flight, smooth take off and landing but no on board entertainment. Good meals in flight. Friendly flight crew. Good value for a direct flight. Could do better with fixing their TVs."
Bilal M,"Got the seats that we had already booked online. The flight departed on time and reached 20 mins earlier at Kuala Lumpur. That was the only available direct flight from Karachi to Kuala Lumpur. The ticket was the most economical among other airlines. Food was served twice and it was delicious. Overall, it was an amazing experience."
patronus.stag,"I have heard lots of negative reviews about PIA. I chose to fly this one as it gave me the quickest route into Lahore and return. Have to say it was great all the way. Now you have to lower your expectations when you travel a budget airline, however it was not a disappointment. Aircraft is clean, seats are standard (although I must say they are running the newer aircrafts on this route as the interior looked fresher). You get a standard meal, soft drinks are offered multiple times along with tea/coffee. Bets part is you don't have to stop anywhere and change aircrafts so no time wastage, its a direct flight which helps save time."
Farah120,Flight departed on time ground staff was very helpful in London and Karachi airport. Cabin crew were extremely helpfull and friendly. I wish if they can improve in flight entertainment and temperature it seem aircon dosent work .
Hashmi H,Direct flight to toronto with. Good average food. Fast arrive. Cheap flight but they dont allow to buy oneway ticket if our visa only tourist visa. Staff not really nice. Fly with child and get free sit to make my child sleep comfort..
Moiz M,had a great flight with great food and hospitable staff...a total value of money and a must experience for all.
Traveler,"Decided to travel PIA after 12 years! why? as its a direct flight and knowing that its going to cause us grief we took the chance. 1. Lhr to Lahore - flight was cancelled on 15 November the day of travel and we were asked to go on 14 or 16 November 2. Lhe to Lhr - flight on 2 Jan was changed to fly out at 1.30 pm a month before departure, no explanation. 3. Lahore airport - nightmare experience by PIA staff, Immigration, Customs and porters. everyone, yes everyone of them wanted some money just to do their job that is to get us onto the flight. After bribing a few people we were allowed into the departure hall. 4. The flight was 30mins late departing, and 4 toilets werent working, it was a full flight. At times stewards cleaned the toilets but didnt replace any tissues or toilet rolls. 5. I spoke to Asma senior purser, who said to provide feedback online to PIA. 6. I sent in a feedback email to PIA and its day 7 NO REPLY has been received. 7. Moral of the story PIA (Perhaps It Arrives) lives up to its name, bad seats, broke TV sets, awful food, awful service, miserable staff so just take a connection, yes it will take longer but you will arrive refreshed. 8. The officials however, will still approach you whether you are Etihad, Qatar or Emirates, they will always try and get some cash off you. Disgusting!"
Seth L,"A year ago, I was returning to China after a short trip to Japan, and I picked the cheapest flight I could find, PIA. While it was cheap, that was one of the few things going for it. While the actual flight was only 3 hours long, we stayed on the runway for 2 hours after its scheduled departure, and waited 1 hour on the plane after we arrived in Beijing. On top of that, the plane seemed a little rickety taking off, hoping that it wouldn't break down, and all the flight attendants' instructions were in Urdu, without much English translation. But hey, at least the airline food was decent."
Saqib R,"I traveled to Bangkok from Lahore a couple of months ago. After comparing fares of different airlines I found that PIA flight was 15000 PKR cheaper than other options. So I chose PIA. I have flown with PIA several times in the past, and I know their service is just average, and my opinion did not change this time. Flights were on time; comfort and service was OK."
Bilal T,"As soon as we took off the pilot welcomed us on board. He told about the route of the journey. Then he spotted beautiful places like lake saifulmalook, lulusar lake, babusar top, nanga parbat, chillas, bunji, haramosh and shigar valley. The journey was very informative and adventurous. Thanks PIA, the national carrier of Pakistan."
DrTomShelley,"On time. We fly PIA because they are the only airline that do direct flights to Pakistan. They also offer very generous baggage allowances, 45kg for economy class to Karachi. The staff are remarkably polite despite some of the passengers they have to deal with. The in flight entertainment system was not working but it was a night flight, so we were more interested in sleeping."
imran s,I have used other airlines that stopover in an Arab country but when I just want a faster direct flight 7.5 hrs instead of 13hrs I use PIA. It isn't great but it gets me there quicker. The seats are shabby and toilets sometimes run out of water and the staff can be rude. Otherwise the food is ok and you get a good baggage limit so that you can take everything your relatives request. I hope they update their planes to the dreamliner which will bring them more customers and improve their service overall.
Kamakazi786,PIA has a lot of negative publicity around it which is not entirely fair. The airlines crew is young and friendly and unlike some Gulf Carriers sturn staff are accommodating. I travelled on its 777 which arrived from Malayasia and while there was a 1 hour delay the captain apologized twice....good to see ownership. There is no in flight entertainment and no giveaways for kids.....this is needed to make it a better airline especially for longer haul flights.
Waheed Zafar,there are no bells and whistles but the service is brilliant and food amazing. the only draw back is poor quality of monitors movies and games. if you take your own iPad and can watch movies this is ideal. price of tickets is half of other airlines and flight times are ideal no middle of night arrivals or departures
14mohammad,"We were coming from Los Angeles to Karachi in Etihad Airways… not knowing that from Abu Dhabi Etihad Airways will hand us off to the PIA we didn’t have too many options but to wait and see. Last time I traveled in PIA was in 2001 and one can already tell that this business will not do well in the future. As compare with other airlines, they were bad in all categories: Unsafe Aircrafts, bad customer service and bad food – after a decade found out that this airline went from bad to worst. Forget about any internment the feeling in the aircraft was very unsafe… on takeoff and landing each and every nut/bolt was shaking like they will come out from their sockets and couple of the overhead compartment fell open. The instructions on where the life waist is, were in English and from God knows which other language. The crew didn’t give us the embarkation cards and we had to go through the hassle of filling them out on the FBI counter. The food was so bad that though we were hungry from all night, we were not able to take another bite of that “spoiled/cold/baasi-food”. The so-called shami kababs were half-wrapped in aluminum foil and were COLD, the bread tasted stale. After reaching Karachi I called Etihad and made sure that we are not going back to Abu Dhabi in PIA. I will not recommend anyone to fly in PIA!!!!"
Hassan R,"they flew late, plane was very old, seating mix up, jam packed plane and not enough space in overhead compartment for people for their carry-ons, service was very bad, my seat just would not stay in place."
Salman A,"well where does one begin......the plane was late in arriving and hence took after 1.45 minutes behind schedule, no apologies tendered, no remorse....then the plane was an attached to a satellite, but we had to take a bus ride which was about 16 minutes......felt like we were going on forever......after boarding the plane, sitting down discovered that there wasn't any inflight entertainment.....NONE...........the food that they served must have been sitting in an oven for over an hour, DRY, EVAPORATED,DRAINED .....what more can i say........never again"
Salman F,"I traveled to Karachi and Back to Lahore last week with PIA... I notices some very positive changes. The Flight was on time infact a little bit before time :). The crew was hospitable, courteous and welcoming. Food was good too. Overall good experience"
mohammed k,terrible airport people trying to steal money of you hassle you for no reason. worst airport I have been in the staff are all looking for a bribe and the airplane is just as bad if you no somebody they will give you better seats upgrade you for free all in all crap
mohammed k,I have to fly this airway because it is a direct flight.if I had a choice I would not step foot on one of there airplanes the planes are old seats don't always recline tv don't work food is crap always take my own food with me.
Dirk W,"We had an early 7.15 morning flight, so you get up at 4.30 to get in time to the airport. Once there, flight cancelled ! No email, no SMS, nothing. Weather conditions were perfect, so clearly, the flight is cancelled because of insufficient travelers. After this shocking experience, we had a further two flights with PIA and got stuffed around even more. PIA has got the monopoly for domestic flights and shows no respect for their customers. Competition badly needed !!"
andymatson,"PIA always my best selection, its direct, its my Country's only Govt own airline. It gives feels of being home. I am sure they have made significant improvement. There is always room for improvement but I would travel with them regardless anyday, Food wise, i do not need to worry about Halal food as its understood. No alcohol-all features make you feel at home."
maz20162017,"flight left 3 hours late from London Heathrow to Lahore Pakistan due to heavy fog in Lahore, small old aircraft no entertainment whole entertainment system was down, typical airline food, Apart from this, a good direct flight at a very cheap price."
amber t,"flight was pleasant, crew showed hospitality but crew was above age to smile enough. it is advised that a more smarter crew should be arranged."
taquir,It was a surprisingly very good experience in travelling Business Class from Karachi to UK and back. Both flights were on time and the atmosphere in the cabin was good with good selection of meals and service by the cabin crew. The only exception was in-flight entertainment which was not functioning. The whole experience was worth the price being charged by PIA as compared to other airlines on this route.
Teymoore,"If you are travelling domestic, then PIA is no doubt the best Airline that covers almost every region and multiple flights during the day than any other domestic carrier They need to improve on the meals though as per their airfare Staff is hospitable but not energetic :) Planes are nicely maintained but needs more attention They need to provide in-flight entertainment which is not present at the moment"
Aijaz S,Flight was on time and it was cheapest flight to compare with other airlines BUT yes when you save money so no fun at all!!!!
Faran Rasheed,"Most of the time the flights are delayed, but you can trust the professional pilots with smooth flight and takeoff/landing."
470kashifs,PIA is my preferred choice of flight because of the smooth take off and landing. Excellent service in terms of flight operations.
ZaimJee,I had flown with PIA after so many years and it was an amazing experience. Even though it was short Domestic Flight from Lahore to Karachi but I was simply amazed by the improved service and quality. The Flight was right on time and landed on time as well. The in flight service was very nice with smiling staff
Sukena R,"I had heard many horror stories about the national carrier, but they didn't disappoint at all. I got a 40% off my ticket, earned miles, and the crew was very professional. The flight was smooth, direct, and highly recommended. PIA is now regularly offering many discounts and offers, and the service is good too. I highly recommend looking into their international flights."
mgtprofessor,"PIA is a Pakistan government owned airline. I took the flight on PIA from Toronto Canada to Islamabad Pakistan in December 2017. The flight was direct and took about 12 hours. The airline business class was clean and stewards and stewardesses were polite, professional, and helpful. The flight was on time and without any incident. The toilets were clean and had all the accessories. The food was good and had a variety to choose from. My luggage arrived in good condition. The seats expands like a bed which allows for a comfortable sleep. Since I fly once a year to Pakistan using different airlines, I think PIA is very similar to Turkish and Etihad airlines both in service and comfort. PIA, however, is direct and always arrives on time or ahead of schedule. I highly recommend this flight."
madmasai,Alhamdulillah the best highlights of the flight was the pilot landed in zero visibility and heavy fog without a bump apart from that its the quickest way to get home although the safety and the services on board are questionable the service on the plane was of low standard food in short supply had to keep on asking for services no amusement on board systems failure
Usman Sabir,I think this is the best service route of PIA. - Tickets are reasonable and price fluctuation is non existence. -Delays dues to Fog in winters is unlikely due to flight timing. - Flight timings suits tourists as the arrival time is 12am and departure time is 1pm at DXB. So its easy for a timely hotel check-in and check-out Overall great value for money
Michael D,"Was flying from Tokyo via Beijing, with a connecting flight to Islamabad, then on to Riyadh. Put up in Narita's Japan Airlines First Class Lounge - Excellent Lounge, one of the best! Flight delayed by 2 hours. Once on board delayed again, so the cabin crew, always attentive, offered a full meal pre-flight... We arrived in Beijing with torrential rain, parked on the apron, not a gate, so no-one allowed off the plane unless Beijing was their destination...cabin crew were again great, no problem, more food and drinks proffered. Worried that I'd miss my connecting flight from Islamabad to Riyadh, and the flight did indeed arrive very late to Islamabad. To make things worse, or so it seemed, there was no 'Transit' lane at Islamabad AP - all must generally exit the airport through immigration - and of course I didn't have an entry/exit visa! Again, the PIA staff came to my rescue, escorted me out of the arrivals hall, out through immigration and customs, back through customs and immigration, and back in to the departure hall! With half an hour to spare to board my flight. But as luck would have it, my flight to Riyadh had also been delayed, so had time to relax over a chai before boarding. So, as said, delays are common, though in my experience rarely cause major problems as PIA staff are excellent. More just a bit of excitement and in the end, fun. I can't speak highly enough of all the staff, and the price for my business class flight was half the price of 'more recognised' international airlines! If you have the time and don't mind the odd delay, well worth trying PIA out."
JJJJJ2013,"First, bad experience was worst delayed flight without notice and then a really old and very very dirty bus was used to transport us to aircraft. That was just Okay. The food was old and low quality. The second time I booked same flight and they booked two tickets in my name. I asked them to cancel one as one person can fly on one ticket only. They said I have to pay cancellation charges. I paid and said goodbye to PIA. PIA, Never Again."
Zahid K,"I just couldn't believe the staff asked me £120 for a £5 for a walking stick treating it as a luggage piece,The supervisor even backed it up speaking from his Gand with out checking what the check in staff asked for"
xman7520000,"Due to a last minute trip, decided to book PIA from Paris to Karachi via Islamabad. A few hours after the booking was done we recieved a call from PIA to reconfirm the details, during the conversation we asked if we could hold our seats. The person asked our preference and we said in front of the plane. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that we were given business seats all the way from Paris to Karachi. Being a long haul flight, the seats were really handy due to more room and leg space. The inflight service was same as economy. The staff was not very usefull as i demanded for a blanket 2 to 3 times but they never gave me one during the whole night flight. Also they were really not bothered about the passangers and were very loud and noisy throughout the night. On the way back we tried to pay and get an upgrade but the flight being full wasn’t possible. The way back was the most horrible flight i have ever encountered in my travel history. Being economy no complaints for the leg space, it was alright. The flight was overcrowded with infants and children who were screaming and crying all the way throughtout the flight and that which was for 9 to 10 hours!!! The flight screens were not working at all , all of them were dead hence there was no inflight entertainment and so couldn’t even watch something to avoid all the outside noise. There was a child aged 7-9 years of age seated in the front of my seat who was a complete nuisance. I can understand children getting cranky but this one was a compelete pain. She was banging the back of her seat with her head and back, screaming her lungs out and kicking the seat in front of her, due to which her seat was constantly banging and hurting my knees. The mother was least bit bothered!! A horrible way to end a hectic journey, was just glad to rush out of the plane. PIA hopefully never again!!!"
Yusuf Moosa,"This was my first time after many years I stopped to travel by PIA due to a very bad experience with it. Anyway I have to travel on a Friday and there was no option except PIA. The same services nothing changed in more than two decades. Food quality not eatable, soft drinks was without any taste and the tea was anything but not tea. Air hostesses dress and look very poor. The only positive thing was that our flight arrived on time."
One_Bangali,"This ageing airline is just mediocre with fares that are not competitive. Ticket prices are ridiculously high. When I traveled with them, the plane was not clean and the food served was of poor quality. As I entered the plane there was a horrid stench! The plane felt humid and smelt like someone had vomited! The seat felt hard like a rock and did not seem to be maintained at all. Some seats were creaky too! Scattered all over the plane were handkerchiefs, diapers, cups, discarded tissues and other rubbish on the floor! The in-flight entertainment system did not work and the content in the few adjacent screens that worked seemed hopeless anyway. Most of the LCD screens where not working however. A “Windows Corrupted” message was displayed instead. The cabin crew were so unprofessional. They don’t even speak to you politely. I saw a male cabin crew literally yelling at a passenger! I requested a blanket but I was told that there are only a few blankets and so I cannot expect to get one. Plus if you complain, you will never get a proper response. One of the expatriate Pakistani passengers sitting close to me was quietly fuming about how foul the smell inside was; how filthy the plane was; how unpleasant the staff were; how despicable the service was; and how shocking the customer service at the airline counter was! Furthermore, Pakistan International Airlines were horrible people to fly with he said! The only plus side was that the flight was punctual and on time. However, this only happens on rare occasions, I was told. Pakistan International Airlines could do more to improve its service, food, planes, staff and etiquette of its cabin crew."
Shafiq S,I will never ever will fly on this airline at all. Plus you make complaint there will never come back with any response . This is budget airline people don't get fool.
MUAZZAM ALI,"Excellent and cheap airline to travel abroad and within Pakistan. Food, staff and comfort is good. A pleasant journey."
Muttaqi,Well improved services and air crafts. Excellent pilots and staff. In flight information was good. Keep updated your self on weather issues.
Haamid J,"Northern Area flights are subject to weather and visibility. We were fortunate both ways to and return from Skardu our flights were on time. The delightful part of this sector is that you get to see the most beautiful terrain and natural beauty from 10,000 meters. Nanga Parbat in its full glory can be seen going to Skardu on the right side of the plane - get a window seat on the right side facing the front. On return the opposite side."
Kamal5372,"Being the only flight operating between Karachi and Gwadar, you have no other option. However, PIA could improve its punctuality, service, food stuff and courtesy of its cabin crew. The only good thing about it is that you don't have to travel by road for 7-8 hours!"
Saad S,"It used to be one of the best airlines in the world . Poor maintenance and lackluster management made it to the lower ranks. Planes and its cabins are old even business class seas though spacious , are a bit rusty . Good thing about this airline is its service in business class which and its food if you got a taste for Pakistani or Indian cuisine. Hopefully they will upgrade their feel improve soon otherwise they will drop to the list of worlds worst airline like Indian airlines just went"
flyfisher66,"First, we were told that the flight will now board at 8 am instead of 10 am. It was a minor inconvenience but we made it to the Skardu Airport well in time. Around 10 am we were told that the flight from Islamabad to Skardu has been cancelled due to bad weather. We asked the airline staff, ""What next? Will we be accommodated in the next flight? ""Sorry, all flight in next week are fully booked"" was the reply. We were horrified to listen this. There were over 100 of us and we had nowhere to go and the only option left to us was to take an 18 hours road journey to Islamabad. Many of the travelers got furious and told the airline staff that they have to adjust us in the coming flights but airline staff closed the window and disappeared advising us that we can claim our refund from Islamabad. This was absolutely disgusting and I never had such an experience in the past. Cancellation / delays in the airflights due to bad weather in Northern Areas of Pakistan is not something unusual and I have experienced it many times in the past. However, never before PIA abandoned us like this. We were always adjusted in the flights on next day or later or were offered a quick refund. Many times PIA flies an extra flight on the same day to accommodate the left over travelers. It seems to me that now there is no accountability at any level in Pakistan International Airlines. Too bad."
Khatpandwa,"Competent staff, smooth flight, good food, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Over all enjoyed this flight along with my family"
Bee A,"If you fly domestically in Pakistan, choose none other than PIA. Despite all the incompetency of the government and inefficient operations, this airline still is one of the most consistent performers in the domestic circuit. On international circuits, this airline is just mediocre with noncompetitive fares which gives the edge to other quality airlines. I would still blindly book PIA for my domestic routes."
Dijas-123,My flight was delayed initially by 3 hours which then turned to 7 hours. The communication to passengers was very poor. There was no representatives around to tell anyone what was going on. Eventually we boarded the flight but it was another 1.5 hours before take off. The plane itself wasnt cleaned and the food served was of poor quality as usual. Thr price of tickets is always ridiculously high. I have promised never to fly with PIA again.
liverpoolLiverpool21,"I booked 4 seats for myself and 3 children on flight PK 721 , 9th August from Manchester to New York and upon arrival at the check in desk was advised I couldn’t fly as I had no return flights booked. This was not mentioned at all during the booking process and I was forced to quickly go to the internet and book return flights before we could check in. When I returned to the check in desk we were advised after a very long wait that there were no seats together but not to worry we could speak with staff at the boarding gate who would help us as they did have a block of 4 together in business class and could move passengers around. The staff at the boarding gate laughed and dismissed me saying this is not possible and advised me to speak with the cabin crew who were even less interested and passed us from one staff to the next trying to sit my 5 year old and 10 year old together at the front of the plane with no adult to look after them and myself in the middle of the plane with my other daughter at the back of the plane alone. I advised the staff this was not acceptable and they told me to just sit down and they would try to move us around once the plane took off ! All the passengers by this time were staring at us and we were made to feel extremely uncomfortable. After several more complaints regarding my children being expected to sit alone with no one to care for them I was begrudgingly given 3 seats together for the 4 of us to share and advised it was the best they could do as the whole flight was full and they didn’t have to accommodate us , they were doing this from kindness !! I was not given any seat belt for the 5 year old I now had sitting on my knee for the whole journey which was not safe and we were just disregarded and frowned upon , I felt we were treated like animals and left extremely uncomfortable for the whole flight. I have raised several formal complaint regarding this matter and to date not been resolved and in fact communication has ceased their end. These flights cost me nearly £1400 one way for the worst experience and most unsafe journey we have ever encountered which gave us a very unpleasant start to our holiday."
ZaimJee,I had traveled with airlines few times for domestic business trips only within Pakistan. Overall average service since the journey distance is very short
Rasheed A,I fly last sunday with pk 0283 everything perpect specially thanks to all crew member but the faisal is very kind respectable host and has colleague also very silently doing has jobs I like this services and I hopes they will keep it up for next time.
Heng How N,"The flight was on 7:15am. Left the hotel 10 minutes before 6:00am and reach the airport at about 6:15am. Check in at counter without much issue at straight to gate 4 for the flight but the gate is not opened for PK390 yet. Once ready, took the bus to the ATR 42 aircraft which is a turboprop plane. Climbed up the small staircase up to the aircraft. Once with the clearance, the flight took off smoothly except the aircon is not cold, or the air came out is warm. Awhile later, the crew serve us with a light snacks with drink. There is no hot drink available. About a hour, the pilots prepared to land on destination airport with ease. Again came down from a narrow staircase and walked towards the luggage claim hall or arrival hall. Wait for awhile and the luggage was on the belt for collection. Out we go for the site/plant."
adss1230,"It's a pretty decent airline and that's about it... PIA has been overtaken by airlines like Emirates and Etihad that have far more superior service and a better product overall. I have heard they give sometimes better deals than the other Gulf carriers, but I think there is a much better experience on any other airline traveling to Pakistan, like Emirates or Etihad. Seats are relatively comfortable, but little variety on in-flight meals. IFE is kinda outdated and the entire cabin product needs a little fresh update overall. Decent airline, but there are better options..."
bluetauras,last min check in they still accommodate me and also upgrade free in business class . 😊 the crew is very nice and experience is great . the breakfast serve with love and care. food is fresh and hot and tasty . Really appreciated.
bluetauras,it is 2nd travel in last six month with PIA. experience is very nice although I heard bad reputation a lot about this airline But every thing is entirely different.it is very good . the flight is on time how so ever there is heavy rain and bad. the staff is courteous. the meal is free fresh and warm with huge smile of staff. Arrival is also good. There is no issue at all. I strongly recommend .
UlsterFryNo1,"When you fly to Skardu, you have to be prepared to take a day or two longer there if the weather's bad. That's what happened to us... not PIA's fault. However, I don't know what we would have done if we hadn't had a local tour guide with us who could get to the head of the queue in the PIA office in Skardu. I would have been totally lost. When we did leave the next day, the flight was perfectly fine."
slapshot81,"I bought a DIRECT flight to Lahore. I was suspicious about the timings that just didn't match the 3.5 hour flight time but paid it no attention. Plane landed, I stood up to disembark and the stewardess came running over over to me.... Stewardess : ""Excuse me sir.... You are for Lahore right?"" Me : ""Yes that's right. Are we not in Lahore?"" Stewardess: ""No sir, this Peshawar. Please take your seat and we will depart for Lahore in 30 minutes"". Me : ""Hang on, this is supposed to be a direct flight to Lahore.... What the hell is going on""?!! Stewardess : ""This is a direct flight sir, via Peshawar""! There was nothing I could do or say so I just went with it. In short, you will need A LOT of patience to fly PIA. Good luck to you!"
AQ2012,"I had my reservations for flying by PIA since in recent times a negative image has been portraying about it. I wanted to fly nonstop and this was the only airline flying from Manchester to Islamabad, so I decided to give it a try. It was a nice surprise. The flight was in time. The on board service was superb. The plane was comfortable. Food was good and all Halal. Plane was neat and clean. Toilets were neat and clean and remained clean till we reached Islamabad. Baggage allowance was more then other airlines.The flight was smooth and comfortable Karachi and back to Islamabad by PIA. Returned back to Manchester by PIA. All the flights were superb, comfortable and the customers were looked after very well. ,"
"Shah, Tayyeb","Although PIA is underrated by many people for their services and time, but my personal experience was totally different. The flight I flew with, was in time, comfortable, the seat was also comfortable, the menu was great and the boarding was free of hassle. I would recommend this airline not only for domestic flights but also for international flights."
rahimworld,You can always expect delay in flights. I don't know what is the problem with PIA staff even though they know very well that customer is keep complaining since long time but no action is taken yet. Perhaps the current Govt don't want to change the national flag carrier. The service quality was average but as usual the flight delay for 30 minutes as they were announcing again and again that the flight is delay due to luggage but still one should make sure that everything should work as per the schedule.
Yagenem,Good service in low cost. Recommended. This is one of most risky airline too. But dont worry. Just do it.
unknownayesha a,"vile service vile staff vile smell filthy plane shocking customer service! and furthermore, vile people to fly with!!!"
Farooq Bhatti,"Normally on my annual vacation I travel with the national flag carrier as the only non stop available flight on weekends. Yet their service requires to be improved a lot. I have been working here in the Kingdom for the last 20 years and have travelled a lot by PIA and have found the airline to get itself improved in booking, boarding service, ontime departures, food quality, Congested seating spaces, crew attention and luggage allowances. I have seen other airlines like SV and GF fully loaded as compared to PIA and even then the booking when searched is sometimes not available. Even with all these improvements to be made, I prefer our National Flag Carrier to Travel."
Furhan1,Business class in name only. Only good thing is the leg room. Food is just ok. Entertainment system often doesn't work and content is pretty rubbish anyway. The only reason for using PIA is they have monopolised the direct flight and convenience. 3 hour delay on way out.
Fareeda M,Travelled to Islamabad from Birmingham on business class with my 11 year old it was a trip to remember excellent service really nice food polite staff.
Gul K,This is International airline and flagship carrier of Pakistan. The best thing is to know what kind of aircraft you are boarding. Not too bad and good for money value.
nellynb,"What a disgusting let down. Flight delayed initially 2 hours and then a further hour on the tarmac waiting for clearance from ISB airport as apparently no parking spaces available for the plane when landed. When we arrived over the airport the plane had to circle for an extra hour due to no parking spaces !!! The plane was boiling hot through the flight as were the minimal drinks offered. The plane had no vanity cases to offer business passengers nor slippers to wear. Blankets smelt damp and made us itchy. Evening meal was nice but breakfast consisted of half a strawberry, a chunk of pineapple, melon and a slice of kiwi, a strawberry yoghurt, a mini croissant and a coffee. Was disgusted as the fruit looked almost rotten !!! Previously when flown business, slippers and vanity case provided and lovely variety of cooked breakfast was offered. Not happy as the price increase was at least £400 per person compared to same time last year but what was provided was disgusting. The plane was also very dirty !! Only use this airline as it is direct may have to look elsewhere for future trips !!!"
WaqasMKhan,"this is the national carrier and the only flight available on this route, hardly worth flying with."
rodney s,"Seriously, 14 hour direct beats a 25 hour stop over. Food was good, flight was smooth. Only thing, for a long haul, their entertainment system needs to be maintained and a better selection. I was scared to travel with this airline but to my surprise, I was pleasantly pleased."
flyfisher66,"Our flight was delayed for more than an hour and the airline staff didn't even bother to say sorry. They looked absolutely indifferent. Last time while traveling from Islamabad to Lahore, they sent my luggage (and of more than 15 other passengers) to Karachi. PIA is getting worst than ever. I am travelling with this airline since 1981 and in good old days, it used to be a very fine airline. No more. There is something seriously wrong and they are very unprofessional in their conduct. They commit and awful mistake and don't even feel sorry about it. When I have a choice, I do not travel with PIA but unfortunately, there aren't many options for domestic travel. PIA management seriously needs to look inwards and improve their standard in almost everything. Their performance is below average in many way."
Furqan,"I am afraid v poor service. Flew with them last year and again March 2017, no improvement. Poor cleanliness, worst maintained hard seats , no entertainment. Food used to be good but spicy now. Staff try best with giving you repeated soft drinks . But big gap between food. Really wished PIA had improved but they are only going due to their Monopoly of being the only direct flight b/w UK and PAk. Is any body reading from their admin ? How many more poor reviews to wake you up ? Extremely expensive for such a poor service."
Shakilahmed1,"Only airline to go direct and was actually early on arrival. I'm shocked! but yes this was the case food was ok rice and chicken, bread, drinks, tea etc. I was disappointed that the entertainment was hit and miss but did enjoy chats with my fellow Pakistani's. The crew are great and always try their best with what little resources they have to make your journey as pleasant as possible with what little resources they have. Sometimes it's the people on the plane which make this journey difficult not the crew I saw a number of people baing disrespectful to crew members and fellow passengers which is not something you expect in this day and age.... Never the less if you want to get to Lahore in 8 hours PIA is the way to go."
rafiqontabe,"Absaloute crap airline, should get shut down! !! Dirty seats with dust hazards, rats in toilets. Food with hair in it ( level 1 hygiene ) . Very bad landing and cabin crew very rude with attitude problems."
Panjtani,"An absolute farce and complete disappointment from start to finish. Firstly at the airport the seat allocation terminal were not working properly which endured a long wait, and when boarding started it was like a rush for the last wagon out of town! On board the seat was dipped in the middle and was creaking at the screws to the floor. The IFE screen had greasy finger marks all over it and the plane was smelling of steamed food and bleach! The Air conditioning was off and upon people constantly requesting were told it would only operate when in the air! There was no distribution of headphones and upon asking was given one after 15 minutes. Then to realise the screen didn't work!!! Again i asked why and was told that it was just being reset and to allow 10 minutes, after 30 minutes asked another attendant who said the screens don't work and I said that was the case 3 months ago to whichshe smiled and replied this is the same plane and nobody really was looking after them properly. To be fair to the staff they did try their best trying to put a brave face on things but there was nothing to smile about. the only reasonable point was the food was ok not good just ok. Its like no other flight anywhere believe me and it was my 6th journey on this route this year and other flights comparatively were heavenly. I hear 2 or 3 routes LHR-LHE and LHr-ISB have what they call a premier service but is dearer and yet to be tried. I think the company is being run into the ground to prepare for a cheap sell off in the usual Pakistani style hence don't expect improvements anytime soon."
Anwar S,"Staff are polite and helpful. Onboard entertainment needs improvement. Sound ports on the armrest are either faulty or the headsets are sub standard. The screen quality is also poor could do with modernisation. Selection of channels and its offerings is pretty poor and not to ones taste The main course on the flight is a choice of lamb or chicken rice with a bit of salad. I had both. Not as good as what it use to be. Bit spicy and probably not befitting for a child.The breakfast served 2 hours or so before landing was a definite No for me. Crossaints, cakes or bread that is either warm to cold doesn't appeal to me. Seats were looking a it frayed around the edges. Pockets on the back of the seats were a bit ripped."
Bashaar,"I must admit, I am totally surprised and impressed when I took the flight from Islamabad to London. As soon as I entered the aircraft, I was welcomed with smiley and smart looking staff (which is slightly unusual). The plane was clean and the seats were comfortable. The pillows were on each seat along with the blankets. All clean. In flight entertainment was ready before the flight was even taken off. The screens were right in front of you (on the back of the front seats) and you can choose from Movies, Cartoons, Games, TV Shows, Airline front and downwards camera and much more. All touch screen. When the lunch arrived, they had a menu.... yes menu with options ! We were offered Fish Pasta, Chicken curry with rice and lamb with rice. I went with chicken rice and my mum went for Fish Pasta. On both the trays, the main course was different but the desert and the rest was same. The desert was chocolate cheese cake. Once we finished with the food, we were offered drinks and then the staff tidied everything up. After few hours we were offered snack and it was croissant with cheese and chicken (extremely tasty and fresh) along with lemon tart and tea. The plane was PIA Premier. When initially I took the flight from London to Islamabad, it was the absolute basic one, but Isb to LHR was definitely a wow. As long as PIA can replicate this to other planes, this will certainly change the perception."
danyal_rana,"Service, not to mention is lacking and satisfactory. In the least, the air hostesses give us males stern, solemn stares. We aren't greeted and welcomed, it is like as though we board a government funded/free of charge airline where we cannot ask for water or questions. You aren't welcomed, asked how is everything or given a positive attititude. only women and children get blankets and pillows, but not the opposite gender. No in flight entertainment, if you ever ask me. This has no element to it. The food is to a decent quality, but apart from main meal times not once are passengers offered tea or drinks and a long distance journey awaits boredom and frustration like this. Service needs to step up and up their game, if this airline wants satisfied customers. Flights are always delayed, never punctual. Staff are disorganised and impatient, so don't bother asking questions. Very ridiculous prices, for what we pay. Better off with competitors, for the sake of a stopover and few extra hours it is still worth the extra effort with which comes satisfaction and decent experience."
bluetauras,"very nice, pleasant experience. food is fresh ,seats are comfortable and the service is quick. on time arrival."
YazzyRaja,It was my 1st experience flying with PIA and boy was it one to remember. Upon departing my bags were checked. I was told that I could not take clothes or food items back with me to uk. I was told that I would need to make a payment in order to let the items go through. I reluctantly did as I did not want to spend any more time arguing. Upon checking in my luggage I had pre booked wheelchair assistance. My luggage went through fine as I was well under the limit. The usher wheeling my mother was constantly begging me for money through the journey. I again reluctantly gave him some money. However when it was time to board the plane he demanded more money. I was disgusted by this and refused. Moving on to the service itself. The flight was delayed by about an hour but we were not well informed. The service on the plane was very average and at one point I was serving myself drinks. The entertainment on board was not working. The plane stank. I did not try the meal so I can't comment. I will not be catching another pia flight ever again.
Amir J,Great service and on time. PIA staff offers curtesy and great service. The seats are comfortable and have enough leg space.
IMRAN S,"As a Pakistani, I love anything that reads Pakistan on it. I flew with Pakistan International Airline in 1989 as an adult. I fell in love with PIA. Since then I flew with many airlines other than Pakistan International Airline because of cost. This year 2016 because of reduced pricing I was able to book a November flight from New York to Karachi for $800 in August. I paid an extra $200 as compare to people flying with Emirates and Etihad Airline. All my friends and family told me otherwise but I was excited that I will be flying with PIA again. I was horrified by the condition of their planes (PK721, PK712, PK307). The seat covers were ripped, seats were broken, broken entertainment system, stained carpet, passengers sit where ever they like to sit, pilot looks like a singer from 1970, cabin crew are elderly people and seemed like they were tired of flying, food taste horrible, terrible booking and reservation system, dirty toilets, staff attitude etc. PNR DBFTUO originally planned to fly back from Karachi to New York on Tuesday Dec 06 . Just check to see how many times this plan was changed by PIA. We were placed on a Domestic flight from Khi to Lhr, where we had to wait for 7 hours to catch morning flight from Lahore to New York. This is not a big hassle but try this with your elderly parents on wheelchair and three kids (5, 4, and 2 year old) and then try this nightmare. Staff at both airport sucks, reservation staff sucks, cabin crew sucks ... because of the plane condition and staff performance I will never fly with them again. I will not add my experience flying for Umrah because it was the same. I spent almost $11,000 with PIA this December 2016 ... never again!"
Ruby_Rayy,"Don't know where to start, completely dire service, food was barely edible, no entertainment whatsoever on both flights, the TV screens do not work. They change flight times randomly, are unable to advise you what time the flight will land. I could go on and on, never again will I fly with PIA!"
rumaila r,Rude staff. Seats were allocated all over the place. Baby cot not provided. Hate it. Will never travel them again. The only advantage this airline have is direct flight otherwise I would have travelled to start with. Worst airline at all times.
Zafar Yaab,"PIA is the only air liner operating on this route, so has no other option. Credits goes to PIA it is continually operating on this hard route without profit with subsidies fare. Flight is totally weather subjected so be ready to listen the cancellation announcement. Ground staff and crew on board, both cooperative and well mannered."
Daniyall_G,"I have used this airline a number of times and have not had (or heard) the best of it and the flight out was no different. Miserable crew and the same at the airport - what do you have to do to get a smile out of these guys! I would rate this a 1 or 2 star however...... The flight back was a completely different story hence why the uprate to 3 stars. The airport staff were friendly and helpful and the cabin crew couldn't do enough for us. It was like two completely different airlines. Get the second crew to train the rest, teach them to smile with a little bit of customer service and PIA could be one of the greatest airlines in the world. The entertainment systems were either not working or not worth watching. One meal was pretty good (hot food) the other a little bland (cold tasteless sandwich)"
ZillNiazi,A horrible experience. The passengers were seated in the aircraft for three hours at the airport and it did not take off because of reasons unexplained. The staff is horrible as I have travelled with PIA several times. Their domestic and international both services suck and are always late. The aircrafts are dirty and most of the seats have ripped fabric. The aircrafts smells of urine.
Saeed_Motiwala,"Our family, 17, passengers flew on 3 flights on the Karachi-Islamabad-Karachi route. Each of the flights was on time, and the staff was friendly, from ground staff to the stewards and stewardesses. This was a nice surprise, after hearing horror stories about PIA. I hope that this is the new norm, and not an exception. Keep it up!"
WMBandit,Very smooth and easy check in from Moenjdaro airport located right next to the archaeological site. A stopover in Sukkar then we landed into Karachi around 9pm sharp. Everything on time- 2 by 2 seating arrangement- comfy seats and ok food. The air hostess is super pretty and very very nice. Smooth take off and landing and so hassle free with baggage claim which is quick. Great to be the only foreigners on the flight. Might try to fly with them on an international flight next time. Super airline with reasonable price
AmirJahangir,"PIA has greatly improved its service standards in terms of flight schedule, food quality and staff employees."
kmc,"This is an average flag carrier of Pakistan. Since it offers non-stop flights from 50 locations worldwide to Pakistan, therefore it is recommended to fly with. This airline used to be a really good airline in the past but lost its quality of services now. Government is working on restoring the goodwill, may rise soon."
Mohammed U,Got to Manchester Airport for 7 in the evening ; i was gonna fly out at 8:40. Check-in was fairly quick and i had no issues with my baggage. 7:45 i said bye to my family and went through to departures where i spent some time shopping in the duty free shops. my gate was 210 and soon it was time to board. was greeted with a smiling stewardess flight depparted on time and dinner was served promptly at a round 9:30. who showed me my seat
JaneX7536ZR,"First time to Pakistan on a business trip and first experience of the airline. I travelled to the main cities on five flights over five days, the airline exceeded my expectations, providing friendly care on these short flights in comfortable seats, some of the Europe airlines could look at this airline. What I really liked was the hospitality of the staff on the ground and in the air, as a vegetarian they went out of there way to make sure I had snacks that were meat free. I would happily travel on this airline again."
AmirJahangir,"PIA has greatly improved its service standards in terms of flight schedule, food quality and staff employees."
Asif A,"This has got to be one of the worst airlines in the world, words cannot express enough how bad they are. The air hostesses have a terrible attitude and are openly rude. The planes are visibly in a poor state, on a 7 hour flight and the tv screens did not even work, air con is never on and food is cheap. Ticket prices are hilarious compared to other top airlines."
Rai S,Excellent food and Excellent service in economy class.Fare is very cheap and service is very good.I travel with my children very bit late but boading staff was very helpful they issue the boarding with very good seats.
AmirJahangir,"PIA has greatly improved its service standards in terms of flight schedule, food quality and staff employees."
Alex M,"I had been hearing very bad experiences about PIA and their staff. I am sharing my personal experience, I found this Air line very comfortable, service is quite fantastic and flight timings were accurate. wish to book in future"
Shaz,"The worst possible airline to choose, the service is awful, I got up mid-flight to find the cabin crew relaxing at the back of the plane , I asked for some coke and was pointed at where it is kept and was told to help myself. The Ac was not working till mid flight and the screens to watch weren't working , when I asked why, I was told that the entire plane was not working properly. Only positive to say is that flight is direct. Never again. 1)poor service 2)nothing working 3)food wasn't the greatest 4)no leg space what so ever"
kemcolian,"As always nothing extraordinary bout the flight, an old 310 aircraft with poor maintenance and cleanliness; on top of it jam-packed - they are getting good business just being the national carrier."
ZakShah70,"PIA used to be known as one of the best in the world but lately, it has had lots of bad press. My trip from London to Islamabad was very pleasant especially the service provided by the cabin crew was a refreshing experience. The crew was polite and forthcoming. It was a very convenient flight with no stop overs. The airline needs to improve on in flight services. As usual, take off and landing was near perfect."
TPS_VT_61,"This was the worst flying experience of my life, and I've flown thousands of times. We were boarded in Dubai. The cabin AC was not working well from the time we were boarded. Then, just before pushing back, it shut off completely. Then after pushing back, there was a mechanical problem with the engines, and instead of returning the passengers to the gate to wait, PIA kept all passengers on board without AC, for 1:15, in Dubai, in summer. The cabin temps quickly rose to something well above 45C. Passengers were yelling to let us off. Nope, they made us stay on. All passengers were soaked through with sweat. Never any help offered. I travel frequently to Pakistan, and usually I've been able to avoid PIA. Now it's a full stop. I will never get on another of their flights, unless there is absolutely no other choice."
zaayernasib,"PIA flights are always delayed, without exception! As usual, there was a 30 minutes delay for no apparent reason at all. Once on board, I was shocked to find out that there was no in-flight entertainment system whatsoever for a 6 hour flight! I didn't even charge my phone properly, thinking i wouldn't need to use it much on the plane. God knows how I managed to pass those 6 hours. I tried to sleep. Guess what? no pillows, no sheets to help with the cold. Typical PIA! We were served breakfast since it was a late night flight. The food was so bad... it made for a sucky start of my vacations :( Return flight was the same..."
FlightPath66,"I usually use Qatar Airways but this year my mother decided to put me on a pia flight because it was direct. Even though i had heard bad things about pia i decided to approach it with an open mind. However, once i arrived, i was so disappointed. The plane was freezing cold and they had run out of blankets. Even as we were boarding a woman behind me asked the hostess ""Can you get me a blanket?"" And she said ""Don't worry, they are coming"" The woman never did get her blanket and neither did i. There was also a shortage of pillows and the ones we were given had barely any stuffing so offered no comfort. As i was travelling alone that time, and with very limited knowledge of urdu, i had to ask questions such as ""Are there anymore pillows, blankets, glass of water etc"" Each time i said this, i was given a blank stare and they began to walk straight past me. Now i understand this is a PIA flight but it is also an international flight which surely means there must be at least someone on the plane who speaks english, unfortunately all the staff could only speak urdu and didn't even know what a blanket, pillow or water was. Even though seatbelt signs were on (an hour after take off, this isnt normal is it? if not then these staff are just lazy) , lots of people were walking around the plane, yet the staff remained hidden behind a curtain. So i decided to get a glass of water to take my meds and as i approached them they told me to sit down but i said i needed water and after staring at me blankly for 7 seconds, i remembered to say ""pani"" then the staff member just pointed at a bottle of water and i had to pour myself a drink... so much for great customer service. The In Flight Entertainment system didn't even work and while most screens had on them the map, time, altitude etc, my screen was just blank. Now i have to go back on pia in a few weeks.. God help me. Seriously though, if pia is appealing to you because of the direct flights, i would suggest emirates or qatar which has a stop over but you can choose one that has a 2 hour stop over and that time goes by so quickly, trust me. I would rather have a 9 hour stop over in Doha than fly PIA again."
643drs,"This airline is our national flag carrier. Due to some management issues, the standard is not maintained properly. Though cabin crew staff is still kind enough to managed in-flight services. I"
Sabhayani,Had a Good experience...Clean....Friendly and Co-operative Staff....Good Food...But Flight TV was not working in 13 hours flight which they said they will fix it soon....
millersfan444,"My wife was hesitant about traveling with PIA, one of the reasons was she does not like hot or spicy food, but when I noticed they did bland (non-spicy) meals and so when I booked the flights I selected the option for special dietry requirements and put that we both wanted bland meals. The problems started at check-in when there was only one person for 2 fights, the other desk was empty, eventually someone else arrived but just sat there for 10 minutes before (after some prompting from another passenger) she decided to help with the checking in. When it was eventually our turn we were asked for our ESTA documents (we have never had documents - it is an electronic system) and in numerous trips to the USA, the latest one 2 months previous, we have never been asked been asked for them. When we said we had no documents we were given our passports back and told we couldn't fly !! We protested and it took the intervention of his colleague to inform him when he put in our passport numbers into the system, the ESTA information would be displayed, which it was. We proceded to the gate and boarded the plane about 30 minutes before take off. Thirty minutes after the take-off time people were still boarding and eventually an announcement was made to say that due to problems at check-in the flight was going to be delayed (why weren't we surprised ?) After we took off I found that my seat wouldn't recline, my footrest didn't work and all the seat back screens around us didn't work. The passenger next to me asked a steward and he went away and came back to say they wouldn't work because it was an old plane. No drinks were brought round and after about an hour the stewardesses came round and handed some meals out, but not to us. The trolly came round with the meals and I said to the stewardess that we had ordered bland meals, she disputed this and then said that they didn't have any and we would have to have the curry. Needless to say my wife couldn't eat it and so just had some of the salad (not the lettuce because the leaves were brown), the bread roll and the cold rice pudding. All in all, not a very pleasant experience and one that we won't be repeating."
suhaibmalik,"I prefer to travel by PIA for domestic flights. This time as well everything was fine, flight was on time, meal was average, crew was good enough at least for me :),"
suhailahmad7676,"This was ATR-42 flight via Zhob in Baluchistan, Pakistan. I am flying with PIA since 1980 and travel with them 300 times. The aircraft's are old and not very clean from inside. the cabin service is alright but the food is sumptuous."
Usman A,Liked the service and the staff but aircraft looked like needing maintenance. Couple of seats were 'out of order'. It was hot in aircraft before take-off. No in-flight entertainment on the long flight.
Shahir Yar K,Our flight took off well in time and despite a stopover in Paris it landed almost in time at Milan. The attitude of the cabin crew was extremely nice and they did everything for the comfort of the Passengers. Th only negative thing was that the inflight entertainment system was not working which made our travel quite boring. The food on board was ok. We had a feeling that PIA is trying its best to Improve. Wish her best of luck.
Arif K,"I have been frequently flying to Kabul for the last so many years. Some years ago PIA also operated B-737 to Kabul but now it operates ATR flights only. ATR flights are bumpy, which makes the flight a bit uncomfortable."
Waseem A,Had great experience. The staff was friendly and nice; the flight was smooth and landing at Dubai International Airport was very smooth. It was good experience.
AmirJahangir,"The Pakistan International Airlines is Pakistan’s flag career and offers best inflight dinning in the country. Despite the reputation, I have found the staff to be professional and courteous. The flight crew has very stylish dressing and they know how to deliver service. The only area where PIA needs to concentrate is their flight operation. So the flights are more on time."
Sarah,The seats are quite roomy for economy class for both the ATR and 777. The domestic flights are always comfortable with good snacks and a very helpful flight crew. The flight crew even fought for our behalf when LHE airport did not have an AC unit for our flight during transit. The international flight departed late but reached KUL on time. The food was good and staff generally ok except some senior air hostesses who were lecturing passengers on the dangers of sugar. The call buttons for air hosts/hostesses were not working so at night when they dimmed the lights you could not get water. Oh and the in-flight entertainment systems did not work.
mwm749,"I prefer PIA while traveling to & from Dubai, as this is perhaps the best time. Takeoff at 0830 am and arriving in Dubai by midday. PIA is on path of its revival to being ""Great people to fly with"" once again.  I found the ground and flight staff to be quite friendly and polite, our flight was bit delayed and we were offered apologizes by ground, flight staff & Captain. The plane was clean and fresh, were offered drinks on seating. Hot Breakfast was served which I found to be more tasty than on other airlines. PIA certainly needs more aircrafts, and should work on ensuring that flights are on time."
Kamran T Ghaznavi,"I always use PIA for domestic flights (mostly for Karachi). This time I decided to travel to KL from my hometown, Peshawar.(Airbus A-310) Flight was on Time. Food stuff was OK (Don't expect too much like Emirates or Qatar) On my way back to PEW, Flight was 4 Hours Late due to technical fault. In flight entertainment was not available. I suggest to PIA to induct Airbus A-300 Aircraft in the fleet for this route and make available quality food stuff and inflight entertainment."
Mumtaz400,"I have stopped using this airline a long time ago. I tried it about two and a half years ago; just being patriotic and regretted it; as flight was delayed both ways. The food was below average and service was also below average. This airline used to be one of the best; as I remember travelling on it every year about 40 to 30 years ago; and we really enjoyed it; even at that time me and my family were travelling on British Airways and KLM. Now due to politicians involved everywhere; hiring is done not on merit basis and poor performers are not laid off. Hence, the end result is terrible. Needs overhauling big time in every department."
Hamza Mahmood,"Overall its a good airlines. But considering the factor of Pakistan Government maintaining the airlines, the things have not proven to be upto the mark in recent past."
FarooqAR,"People are usually very critical of PIA, and many a times it is justified, but my experience of flying with four family members was positive Check In was smooth, breakfast served was hot and tasty and overall flight was smooth."
Shahid B,I flew from Manchester in July to Islamabad and then i returned in August and I was very disappointed with the airline. First of all the departure flight to Islamabad was 2 hours late and I wasn't informed until I got to check in and on my returne flight again the departure time was changed and late again. the air conditioning wasn't working and in flight entertainment was not working and when asked about it the crew wasn't very helpful. they keep charging high prices for the flight to pakistan and the service they provide is not worth the penny. I would not recommend it to any one. I am very disappointed and would hopefully not travel again on PIA.
sheepdoggydog,"Don't know how this lot are still allowed to run a service. Got on the plane to be overwhelmed by petrol fumes coming in through the ventilation system. The carpets and overhead compartments were being held in place with duct tape everywhere. The staff were the rudest, grumpiest lot I've ever had the displeasure to encounter. When we landed in Beijing one member of staff just sat in his chair with his feet up looking out the window and one who did bother to get up just offered me a death stare as I alighted. No entertainment, no options with the food (veal or nothing), gum in the ashtrays, dirty seats...you get the picture."
kemcolian,"A very comfortable flight and pleasant cabin crew, though there was a delay in landing (for security reasons I guess - we were told that the runway is not clear, but its anybody's hunch how can the clearing of runway take a full hour) despite starting on time."
fizzLahore,"The worst customer services inadvertently experienced and I was business class passenger. Arrived ar Airport when we are about it board we were told a part is missing from plane and is delayed for twelve hours. Called again after couple of hours and we're told that the part is flying from another city. Called again and said all is good please come. When came again flight again delayed for 5 hours. Unfriendly rude pathetic staff. , worst crew, filthy aircraft with bugs and dirt in seats. Zero entertainment, hard seats.. The worst in the world probably. Take a donkey cart which will better than this excuse of an airline."
Kazi A,"Took the above flight, was a very pleasant experience AFTER flying US airlines which offer nothing & have very rude ground staff & cabin crew, flying PIA was a breath of fresh air, their ground staff was very nice & check in was a breeze, their business class lounge is basic but has free wifi, soft drinks/juices/tea/coffee, news papers, & sandwiches & other goodies to satisfy hunger. The Flight left on time, cabin crew was superb welcomed with a genuine smile & personally seated me. Their Inflight service was superb it was only a 1 hr 30 minute flight but they served full hot breakfast with several choices, I tried 3 of them & they ALL tasted very fresh & very tasty. The Plane was A320-200 which was a bit old & the seat cushion needed TLC, but plenty of leg room & generous recline(More than comparable 1st class in US domestic Airlines). Baggage arrived in less than 20 minutes. All in all a very pleasant experience. Keep it up but do try to buy newer planes."
AmirJahangir,"I have heard a lot of things against the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), however my experience was excellent. PIA has a great safety policy. The food quality has came down to some extend but the lunch and dinner options are still very good."
sanam k,"This is a PIA Airline - The ticket costs over £700 and we went in peak times , the service was poor considering I was going with family and we had a baby , no cot for baby , no space for legs or anywhere to change baby nappy , just crowded airline , food diabolical and the hostess was a bit too posh , stuck up , gosh , I don't know why , usually other airlines , very friendly but here busy chatting to each other"
SubbarGillani,"Airline which used to be amongst world leading airlines is now nowhere in the radar. service level and plane conditions both have gone down with time. Airhostesses majority of them are not very hospitable not eager to help, limited entertainment options but good for people having taste of old Pakistani dramas and shows. The best thing about the airline is the taste of the food which is still the best"
waqarsarwar,An average airline with average services. Definitely not the standard of a national carrier. Need to improve a lot.
0504Traveller,"We hadn’t flown with a Pakistan-based airline for a while, but we were looking to fly from Lahore to Karachi (a domestic route). Each airline serves this route with varying frequency – PIA has the biggest frequency while airblue has the least frequency. Their prices vary as well, with SAI and airblue relatively the same price and PIA prices depending on flight time and availability. All of the airlines are full-service, meaning that standard with the ticket are allocated seats, checked baggage, hand-carry baggage, and meal + drinks on board. The difference between the airlines are service on the ground, their service on-board, their safety record, as well as their on-time performance – none of the airlines have a reputation which excels at any of these though. For our flight, we decided to try PIA from Lahore to Karachi and then SAI from Karachi to Lahore (I had previously tried airblue for an international flight). This is my review of Pakistan International Airlines from Lahore to Karachi in April 2016. It has been a long time since I had flown with PIA – in fact more than 20 years. PIA had originally been a good airline, with decent service and a decent on-board product. As time went by their service, on-time arrival and departure, and customer service went down. This did not instill a lot of confidence in the airline, thus why we stayed away. We decided to give them a try on a quick domestic flight before deciding on whether to fly them internationally. Since PIA has been around for a while, and they are the national airline, they have a lot of resources so they are able to provide more options in terms of flight times. I went online to reserve my ticket, and noticed that they had a lot of flight options throughout the day. The flights were operated by various aircrafts and ranged in prices. We had initially booked the evening flight online which was operated by an Airbus A320, but due to technical reasons we could not confirm our flight. We were instructed to go to a travel agency or PIA office for payment and ticket confirmation. When we went to the office, we changed to the morning flight to allow us more time in Karachi, it was less expensive, and it was a chance to experience PIA’s Boeing 777. Why a Boeing 777 is being used on a 1hr45 minute flight is a good question – some reasons given were the high demand on the route while other reasons were that this plane needed a technical check and that takes place in Karachi. Whatever the reason, we booked a morning flight which was scheduled to depart Lahore at 11am and arrive into Karachi at 12:45pm. PIA is a full service airline, so when we booked our ticket we were able to select our seats. Our ticket included checked baggage, a meal/light snack (depending on the timing of the flight), as well as carry-on. PIA does not offer web check-in so we had to go to the airport to deposit our bags and collect our boarding passes. We arrived to the airport early – even though they recommend 2 hours, most passengers go to the airport an hour before the scheduled departure. PIA is not known for its on-time departures and even though boarding time was scheduled for 10:30am, we did not start boarding until almost 10:50am. The operating plane was a Boing 777 that was in retro PIA livery and from the outside, the plane looked very nice. Boarding finally started and we made our way to the plane. On the jet bridge, before entering the plane, there was a stack of newspaper available for the passengers. The newspapers available were a wide variety of local and international, and available in both English and Urdu. When we entered the plane, we could immediately tell that 1) this plane did not originally belong to PIA and 2) PIA seemed to have only updated the outside and did very little to nothing on the inside. The plane had belonged to Vietnam Airlines and PIA had not changed the interior. The seats were in the Vietnam Airlines color scheme and patterns; the PTV had either the Vietnam Airlines logo or something written in Vietnamese displayed; the information on the back of the tray tables was written in Vietnamese and English; and finally there was Christmas music playing on the speakers. The only modifications to the plane PIA had made was the outside paint job, and they put PIA seat flaps on each seat. The plane was in a 3-3-3 layout and was divided into Business Class, Economy Plus, and three sections of economy – the entire plane was completely full. The seats themselves were decent and comfortable enough for the short flight, but definitely not comfortable for long-haul sector. The seat pitch was average, not too tight but not too generous and decent enough for the short flight. The PTVs were very old, had small screens, and did not work. Half the screens continued to show the Vietnam Airlines logo, while the others displayed the flight map. Even when the safety video was screened, only the videos on the walls displayed the video instead of displaying on each PTV. The service on the plane was good given the short sector. We were in the economy and as we reached cruising altitude, the attendants served a snack. The snack consisted of half a sandwich and dessert. While not a lot, it was enough for the short sector. Complimentary soft drinks and juice were also distributed along with the meal. After the meal, both tea and coffee were offered – in fact tea and coffee were offered several times. A good aspect was the service on the plane, as the flight attendants were constantly in the aisles passing out food or drinks, collecting the waste, and answering passenger questions regarding PIA’s frequent flyer program. Announcements were made in both English and Urdu and some interesting items that happened during the flight – when the flight attendant was welcoming the passengers and talking about the plane, she mentioned something I had not heard before. She said ‘this is your national airline, so please take care of it’. That is something I have not heard before, and I was not sure if it was something new as a PR or part of their turnaround (PIA is going through transition and had recently been through strikes by their worker. The second interesting thing was the Captain’s announcement – when the Captain came on to talk about the flight, he sounded like a newscaster reading out the news. He also spoke for a while, as he spoke for a good length in English and then translated everything in Urdu. We landed in Karachi a bit behind schedule and taxied to our gate and deplaned. Overall, it was an interesting experience with PIA. I had a lot of hesitation when booking my travel with PIA – they are not known for an on-time departure, for their on-board service, nor for having updated planes. I experienced some of that (not an updated plane) but was overall generally pleased with the service on the plane. The service and the experience were decent and good enough for the short-haul domestic sector, but I don’t think I would choose PIA for long-haul. From what I have heard others who have travelled internationally on PIA, my experience on the short-haul is similar to the international sector – with decent service but older planes and non-working PTVs. PIA has some potential, but definitely needs some work. Their motto is ‘Great People to Fly With’ and while it was not a great experience, it was better than I expected."
DaniyalALI,"The flight was good and comfortable one but the food and other necessities were just above par... We also had a failure of an engine so we had to make an emergency landing in London, Heathrow."
neelofer,Good experience when the journey started at Toronto Pearson as were able to see the waiting lounge in its state of art form. It has been thoroughly renovated with nice attractive off white seats and tables with 4 ipads for 4 chairs. Very impressive and enjoyable area. But when it came to the journey on PIA really it was all crowded at the airport. Even in the plane it was very crowded and I could hardly get a chance to go to the washroom. I wanted to change my seat as it was a window seat with another elderly person sitting who was most of the time sleeping. After that I tried to go to the back of the plane but could not sit there as they were not letting us sit and said that it was an old plane and they could not put load on the seats. The internet of the plane was not in order. When I departed from Lahore to Toronto even then a lot of time is wasted standing in lines at the airport almost 3 hours- just a headache and time waste. Other airlines do not take that long like Etihad. Even in the plane the plane was ok but crowded. At the airport the security is not that good as they do not tell you to take off your shoes or jacket. They also do not tell you to take out the laptop from the bag while during the screening. It would be great if they do the checking thoroughly. We paid $1040 for the ticket and then again had to pay $350 to change the date of the flight. So the ticket actually became $1390 and the return date could not be changed. So if we wanted to get that changed we were to pay again almost the same amount $350 Why not try some other airline next time. The washrooms become dirty and messy soon with tissue paper and water around. Sorry to say but People need to behave and be decent while travelling.
Salman Q,"I have known P.I.A (Pakistan International Airlines) as one of the top 10 airlines in the world. The services deteriorated over the last two decades. I have been travelling a lot lately, so I can comment on the services now. Recently I have seen considerable improvement in the quality of service. I am now in a position to recommend it to others."
abwah,"The worst airline I have ever flown on. Terrible customer service, old aircraft with no air conditioning. No in flight entertainment. Should be privatized as soon as possible. The only reason this was used because it goes direct to Islamabad."
Jawad_Kashmiri,Do they not have clocks and watches in their offices? the only worst thing about PIA is that it is never on time. Food is also just okay. The staff is co-operative though.
Asim K,Karachi airport facilities were good . PIA is batter than private airlines confused staff.Staff tried to be cooperated but mostly confused female and males both don't know why? Over all it wasn't bad experience but not enough for money they charge .
Ryan A,"For Isb to Kchi its still the best airline you can get, and its not as bad as you think, however if you think about all the rest of airlines in the world its pretty poor...I have been on theis flight 3 x, I loiked it when they served biryani, but the other two times they served a sandwich that I think was stale bread."
Bushra,"I booked this flight Dubai to Islamabad in February 2016. It was terrible to fly with PIA. The staff is extremely rude, the fare of the flight is so high, the food is very bad, planes are not clean. The PIA staff did not uploaded my luggage in the plane including the luggage of 30 other passengers and we came to know on the baggage claim in Islamabad that our luggage was not uploaded. The PIA authorities told that it will arrive in the next flight but it did not, instead it was sent to the flight going to Karachi from Dubai after 3 days. When I checked it with the airport I came to know that we were not the only who faced this difficulty but there was a store of PIA full of baggages of passengers that reached Islamabad after several days from Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Jaddah, and other origins. However, my baggage was retrieved after facing a great difficulty on the 12th day of my arrival in Islamabad."
Israr S,very poor standards from check in to arrival. Flew from Manchester to Karachi via Lahore. The plane stank! a mixture between a curry chef's armpits and an open sewer. Food was ok. The inflight entertainment was a joke in that only 1 screen out of 3 worked. PIA were much better on the domestic LHE - KHI route with the new A320s that are now in service. Had to clear customs in Lahore and check back in for domestic flight. PIA misplaced my baggage on the domestic route. It arrives 10 hrs later which caused me a lot of issues as I had a wedding to attend the same evening. To PIA my predicament seemed a joke!
Safenoble,"A very full aircraft with many children and babes in arms, long slow check in at Heathrow with extreme care being made as to authority to travel or visas.Excellent cabin service, lovely staff, arrival on time in Islamabad to a seething mass of people. There are many airlines doing this route the National carrier is perfectly acceptable."
